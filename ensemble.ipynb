         "Darrell Lucus",
         "House Dem Aide: We Didn't Even See Comey's Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) \nWith apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week-FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton's email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn't hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”-which we now know to be Anthony Weiner's sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn't matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins-at least two years' worth, and possibly an entire term's worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him-resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz' sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn't even know about Comey's letter at the time-and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn't receive Comey's letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn' receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \nSo let's see if we've got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn't even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn't trample on basic standards of fairness, I don't know what does. \nGranted, it's not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz' planned fishing expedition. But that doesn't mean we can't turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

         "Daniel J. Flynn",
         "Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.' What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton's 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November's election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren't I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn't president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.",

         "Consortiumnews.com",
         "Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \nBy Lawrence Davidson \nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government's payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out - specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \nA “partnership” is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” \nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want - a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \nThe Believers \nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth - that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \nTherefore, if someone feeds them “snake oil,” they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors - those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview - have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. \nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council - yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, “ We're looking for truth. But we're particularly looking for truth that works. ” Now what might that mean? \nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview - their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not “work.” So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. \nOn the other hand, as long as what you're selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory - the list is almost endless. \nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers - the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class - presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare's determination that “what is past, is prelude.” Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will - no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.",

         "Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month - the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \nThe US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder's return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \nRais' son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” \nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau's data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic - known as a “double-tap” strike - is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

         "Netflix Casts a Wider Net for Original Documentaries - The New York Times",
         "Glenn Kenny",
         "It was early in March 2015, the filmmaker Ava DuVernay recalled recently, when she was approached by Lisa Nishimura, the vice president for original documentary and comedy programming at Netflix, who asked “if I had any story I wanted to tell. ” As it happened, Ms. DuVernay had been thinking “about an overview of where the United States currently stands in terms of mass incarceration. ” By September 2016, the resulting movie, “13th,” opened the New York Film Festival. In January, after screening in some movie theaters, being made available free to some academic institutions and streaming on Netflix, the movie received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature. “13th” was one of several pictures produced by streaming services to make it to the Oscars this year, but Ms. DuVernay (who was coming off an intensive Oscar campaign for her 2014 film, “Selma,” when she first spoke to Netflix) said that awards weren't her concern when making the film. Nor could she pursue them after “13th” was out she had already begun her next film, the fictional “A Wrinkle in Time,” adapted from the Madeleine L'Engle book. She also didn't make press junket rounds ahead of awards season. What secured the nomination were two things: the movie's extraordinary quality and the perspicacious marketing department at Netflix's documentary division. A couple of months back, I wrote about some of Netflix's original films, lightweight comedies of varying quality. Several developments suggest a widening of the company's ambitions in documentaries. The service began streaming the Sundance Film Festival's Jury Prize winner, the dark drama “I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore,” a month after the movie won that prize. And, in what movie business journalists are almost unanimously terming a major coup, Netflix announced its acquisition of the rights to “The Irishman,” a   return to the gangster genre from Martin Scorsese, in late February. The documentary division, though, has been moving from hit to hit since the   series “Making a Murderer,” which, along with HBO's “The Jinx” and the podcast “Serial,” gripped the public imagination with innovative approaches to true crime. Ms. DuVernay's “13th” made the   lists of many film critics in 2016, and it wasn't the only   documentary to be nominated for an Oscar this year “White Helmets,” about the war in Syria, actually took home a statuette in the Documentary Short category. Netflix also presented “The Ivory Game,” a Leonardo   exposé of elephant poaching. Flexibility of formatting is one component of this success story. On March 28, Netflix will premiere “Five Came Back,” about a group of prominent Hollywood directors and how they were changed by World War II, in three episodes. Mark Harris, the film's screenwriter and the author of the book on which it is based (who is a longtime colleague and friend of mine) noted that had the project been picked up by a television network, “the directive would have been, ‘Please fill this   slot.' Whereas with Netflix, the first thing they asked was ‘What should this be? '” Ms. DuVernay recalled that Netflix's commitment to making “13th” what she thought it should be remained consistent for the entire process. “After I started it, I realized that it needed to be about more than the immediate situation, and I wanted to add historical perspective” she said. “That meant an expanded budget, and expanded time. ” She noted that she wanted a      cut reduced to 100 minutes. “Lisa told me, ‘It can be two and a half hours.' The   length was something I wanted. ” Ms. DuVernay added, “The division is filled with people who are real filmmakers, who have made documentaries, been in the editing room. ” What it looks like to the creator is borne in mind throughout the process Netflix's goal over all, according to the filmmakers working with them, is to create distinctive stories. “In this line of endeavor, you hear about things like network notes, and that's always a kind of vicious punch line,” Mr. Harris said. “We kept waiting for that moment, but it never came. [Netflix] was always constructive and supportive. ” Ms. Nishimura, the executive making all this possible, said she was lucky “to have come from a professional background that supports creators first. ” Before joining Netflix almost a decade ago, she worked with Chris Blackwell, the music entrepreneur who founded Island Records, at the indie film company Palm Pictures. When she joined Netflix, it was a DVD rental entity, and she was buying up titles and “overseeing relationships with creators worldwide. ” In the process, she discovered that audiences had a hunger for documentaries not always reflected at the box office. “Television ratings exist because of ads, which we're free of, and box office has become so reliant on Friday night returns that it's warped perceptions of what audiences want,” Ms. Nishimura said. “Just because a person doesn't go see a documentary on a Friday night, it's not a reflection on the film it's just a reflection that maybe a documentary isn't a film that a couple is going to want to see on date night. What we've discovered is that we can elevate storytelling and bring it to a global platform and create a cultural moment. ” (According to a Netflix spokeswoman, 73 percent of all subscribers  —   more than 68 million  —   watched at least one documentary on the site in 2016.) “Making a Murderer” certainly created a cultural moment, and “13th” did so on a scale that even its creators did not necessarily expect. “When we created it, we wondered whether or not it was a uniquely American story,” Ms. Nishimura said. “Really it's a story of ‘the other,' and how we treat each other as humans, and what can happen when that goes awry. And so it did get a response from a global audience. And will continue to. The docs live on our service forever. We're allowing stories to continue to find their ceiling over time. ”",

         "Aleppo Evacuation Effort Restarts, and Assad Calls It History in the Making - The New York Times",
         "Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad",
         "BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   After months of fierce bombardment and failed diplomacy, the Syrian government began removing residents from the last   districts in the city of Aleppo on Thursday, a process that solidifies President Bashar  's control over the country's largest city. Cold, hungry and carrying satchels and children, about 1, 000 people, some of them wounded, boarded green buses and ambulances that carried the first batch of evacuees out of the rebel enclave. A second group of more than 1, 000 people departed later, and a third left after nightfall. Mr. Assad hailed the evacuation in a video released by his office, saying the “liberation” of Aleppo would serve as a historical watershed, like the birth of Christ, the revelation of the Quran, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the two world wars. “I want to confirm that what is happening today is history that is being written by every Syrian citizen,” Mr. Assad said, smiling in a dark blue suit. “Its writing did not start today. It started about six years ago when the crisis and the war on Syria began. ” It remained unclear how many people, both civilians and fighters, remained in eastern Aleppo, but aid workers guessed it would take several days to get them out. If successful, the evacuation will return the whole city to Mr. Assad's control, signaling a major turning point in the nearly   conflict. Since early in the war, Aleppo, once the country's industrial center, has been split, with the government holding the west and rebels holding neighborhoods in the east. But vast military aid for the Syrian government from Iran, Russia and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah turned the tide in the government's favor, allowing it to surround the rebels. The evacuation deal was reached between Russia and Turkey, which backs the rebels, after months of heavy shelling and airstrikes that left entire neighborhoods in ruins and killed hundreds of people. Rebels in east Aleppo had also frequently shelled   areas, killing civilians there, too. Many people on that side of the city considered the rebels dangerous militants and were glad to see them ousted. The United States, which has supported the rebels along with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, has struggled and failed to reach an accord to end the war, and the United States did not help broker the evacuation agreement. “There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the indiscriminate and savage brutality against civilians shown by the regime and by its Russian and Iranian allies over the past few weeks, or indeed over the past five years,” Secretary of State John Kerry said. “The Assad regime is actually carrying out nothing short of a massacre. ” The loss of a foothold in Aleppo would be a major blow to the opposition, which would then hold sway in only one of Syria's provincial capitals, Idlib, where the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda is a major force. The less territory the rebels hold, the harder it is for the United States and its allies to get the Syrian government to negotiate with them, the Obama administration's goal. Residents reached in eastern Aleppo on Thursday said they felt the gravity of leaving places where they had lived and suffered for so long. Some bid farewell to places and things they would miss, while others pondered why the opposition had failed. Realizing he would be leaving soon, Hisham Skeif said he had visited his family's home and sat by an old tree, where he thought about Native Americans and Palestinians  —   other peoples forced from their homes. “I never understood such feelings until today,” he said. “This is my  's land. It is not only my memories, but theirs as well. ” While he had participated in the uprising against Mr. Assad that started the conflict, he felt that it had gone wrong by resorting to arms. “Today, hours before we leave, I say that our biggest mistake was carrying weapons,” he said. Others assumed that as declared enemies of the Assad government, they would never be allowed to return and left messages for those who would come later. Salem Abualnaser, a dentist, left a handwritten note on a whiteboard near the door of a small community center for children. “Warning! Do not destroy! There are things here that your children may benefit from,” it read. Reached in a Facebook call on Thursday, Mr. Abualnaser said he had put the sign up because he had heard that government troops had looted other neighborhoods after seizing them from the rebels. “The situation here is better today and people are relaxed a little bit because all the shelling and airstrikes that we had yesterday have stopped,” he said. Others appeared to be covering their tracks as they left east Aleppo. Television images of the rebel enclave showed rising columns of smoke, which activists said were because fighters had set fire to their headquarters and ammunition stores. The evacuation's start was delayed twice, once Wednesday morning when militia fighters unhappy with the deal fired on vehicles trying to bring people out, and on Thursday, when gunfire targeted rescue workers clearing rubble from a road, killing one and wounding three, according to Maan   an antigovernment activist. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the government and tracks the conflict from Britain, said that the presence of 250 foreign fighters among those to be evacuated also complicated the deal because the Syrian government wanted to detain them for interrogation. It remained unclear how that issue was resolved. But evacuation efforts restarted Thursday morning, with apparent modifications to the plan. Syrian state news media reported that buses and ambulances had begun evacuating residents from two Shiite villages in neighboring Idlib Province that have long been surrounded by Sunni rebels. The two villages, Fua and Kfraya, were not originally part of the evacuation deal. The moves to evacuate people from the villages suggested that they had been added to the deal to ensure that people in eastern Aleppo would be allowed to leave. Live images on Syrian state television showed the line of green buses and ambulances emerging from the rebel enclave into a   area, and antigovernment activists filmed their arrival in   territory further west, where many evacuees broke into tears and ate apples and cookies handed to them. Under the agreement, civilians evacuated from eastern Aleppo can stay in   sectors or continue to   areas. Rebels may only go to other   areas. Most were likely to end up in Idlib Province to the west of Aleppo, where a rebel alliance that includes the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda dominates. Some aid workers feared that moving the Aleppo residents there would merely lay the groundwork for a future siege. “I don't know what will happen in Idlib, but if there is no   or political accord then it will become the next Aleppo,” said Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy for Syria. When east Aleppo was besieged by government forces and their allies, the United Nations reported that more than 250, 000 people were trapped there. But on Thursday, Lt. Gen. Viktor Poznikhir of the Russian military's general staff said that 900 militants had been killed in the recent offensive against the   neighborhoods and that more than 108, 000 civilians had fled the area, including more than 3, 000 rebels. Speaking to journalists in Geneva, Jan Egeland, the United Nations humanitarian adviser for Syria, said that an estimated 50, 000 people had fled eastern Aleppo. The discrepancy in the numbers could not immediately be resolved. The United Nations has not been able to provide protection for those fleeing, he said, because its workers were not given access. “We have not been witnesses to atrocities that we know have been committed by all sides in this horrific war,” Mr. Egeland added. The plight of those trapped in eastern Aleppo as supplies have dwindled and destruction has spread has caused anguish among humanitarian workers. “It took 4, 000 years to build Aleppo, hundreds of generations, yet one generation managed to tear it down in four years,” Mr. Egeland said.",

         "Friends Say Minnesota Attacker Was ‘Normal American Kid' - The New York Times",
         "Mitch Smith and Richard Pérez-Peña",
         "ST. CLOUD, Minn.  —   The man who the police say stabbed 10 people at a mall here on Saturday seemed like a model of assimilation, not a violent jihadist, people who knew him and his family said. The son of Somali refugees, he lived in the United States most of his life, did well in school, played sports, worked as a security guard and took classes at a local college. But a new description has been applied to him: terrorist. As he stalked through the Crossroads Center mall, wearing a security guard uniform and wielding a knife, the attacker, identified by officials on Monday as Dahir Adan, 20, mentioned Allah and asked at least one victim if he was Muslim, the police said. A report by a news agency linked to the Islamic State claimed on Sunday that a “soldier of the Islamic State” was behind the stabbing. The F. B. I. is investigating the attack as a possible terrorist act. But law enforcement officials were unsure whether Mr. Adan had made contact with any terror organization, or had “” heeding the online calls to radical jihad that terrorist groups have used to goad Westerners into mounting attacks at home. The St. Cloud police chief, William Blair Anderson, stressed that the investigation had barely started, adding, “I want to know everything about this individual since the day he was born until last Saturday. ” “He was a normal American kid,” said Jama Alimad, a leader among St. Cloud's ethnic Somalis and a friend of the Adan family, who had seen Mr. Adan as recently as this summer. “I can't see anyone more assimilated than that guy. ” As customers in the mall fled the attacker and rushed for the exits, the rampage ended when Mr. Adan was shot and killed inside Macy's by an   police officer. On Monday, the St. Cloud police raised the number of wounded from nine to 10, explaining that they had learned of a victim who had not immediately sought medical treatment. None of the eight men and two women who were stabbed suffered   injuries, and none remained hospitalized, officials said. The mall reopened on Monday morning. Since the attack, people who had encountered Mr. Adan have tried to reconcile the quiet,   youth they saw with the bloody accounts of his actions. People who have spoken with his family said that he had shown no signs of radicalization, and that on Saturday, he seemed to be in good spirits and said he was going to the mall to buy a new iPhone. “That's something he was hiding very well if indeed he did that,” said Haji Yussuf, director of UniteCloud, a group that tries to resolve tensions between cultures in the city. Until the police release video recordings of the attack, “we cannot believe the speculation we hear,” said Mohamoud Ismail Mohamed, executive director of the Saint Cloud Area Somali Salvation Organization, who said he helped the Adan family settle in St. Cloud about seven or eight years ago. “What happened that night between leaving home and the shooting is the million dollar question. ” A few of Mr. Adan's friends and schoolmates took to social media to express their disbelief and confusion. One called Chammy said on Twitter, “He was such a sweet humble guy, and that's still how I see him. ” Abdulwahid Osman, a lawyer for the Adan family, released a statement Monday night saying that Mr. Adan's relatives wanted to express their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the injured and their prayers for recovery. “As a family, we are committed to fully cooperating, within the limits of the law, with all relevant law enforcement agencies as they conduct their investigation,” the statement said. The statement also urged people “not to rush to judgment or conclusions” and said “our family loves St. Cloud and this state. ” President Obama said that he was being briefed on the Minnesota investigation, and that there was no sign of a link to explosions in and around New York City on Saturday. “At this point, we see no connection between that incident and what happened in New York and New Jersey,” the president said at a news conference in New York, where he was attending the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Alimad said Mr. Adan had immigrated to the United States as a toddler and grew up in St. Cloud. He said Mr. Adan excelled in school, and was not especially religious, though also not an atheist. “We need to get to the bottom of this,” he added. “We need to know what triggered this kid. ” The Star Tribune in Minneapolis reported that Mr. Adan lived with his father in an apartment in St. Cloud. The father said his son was born in Kenya, where many Somalis have fled to escape the   civil war in their country. He graduated in 2014 from Apollo High School in St. Cloud, then enrolled at St. Cloud State University, intending to major in information systems, the university said, but he was not enrolled for the fall term. Mr. Adan worked part time for a global security firm, Securitas, which assigned him to weekend guard duty at an Electrolux facility in St. Cloud, according to both companies. Securitas released a brief statement saying that Mr. Adan had quit in June, offering little else about his history with the company, except that he “was hired in accordance with Minnesota state law and company policy. ” Family friends said he had a security guard job at the time of the attack, but it was not clear where. The attacker was stopped by Jason Falconer, an     police officer in Avon, a nearby town. “He's a firearms instructor for the City of Avon,” said Corey Nellis, Avon's police chief. “He's a competitive shooter. If I was going to ask anybody to fire live rounds in a crowded mall, I would trust his abilities next to anybody's. ” Chief Nellis said that Mr. Falconer, a former police chief in another nearby town, Albany, worked only an occasional shift for his department in fact, he was not scheduled to work over the next two months. Minnesota is home to about 25, 000 Somalis, the largest concentration in the United States. Some have flocked in recent years to St. Cloud, a small city northwest of the Twin Cities, in search of safety and jobs, where Somali leaders say they have mostly been made to feel welcome. “Knowing your neighbor makes you less fearful of your neighbor,” said Mayor Dave Kleis, who said the city has worked hard to welcome and integrate the newcomers. Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat who has long been an outspoken advocate for immigrants, said at a news conference on Monday, “I implore citizens of St. Cloud, and really citizens throughout Minnesota, to rise above this tragic incident and to remember our common humanity, our shared citizenship, and our shared desires to live together peacefully. ” But Somalis said there was a widespread fear of a backlash after the attack. “We are really fearful,” Mr. Alimad said. “Kids are afraid. Women are afraid to go to shop. And this is happening in the land of the free. ”",

         "Nearly Four-Fifths of White Evangelicals Say They'll Vote for Donald Trump - The New York Times",
         "Laurie Goodstein",
         "Nearly   of white evangelical voters plan to cast their ballots for Donald J. Trump despite his multiple marriages, lack of piety and inconsistency on the issues they care about most, a new poll has found. Support for Mr. Trump among white evangelicals is even stronger than it was four years ago for Mitt Romney, the previous Republican nominee for president, according to the poll of religious voters, released on Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. White evangelicals make up about   of all registered voters and are a coveted bloc who, when energized, can turn out the vote through their churches and social networks. It has been unclear to what extent Mr. Trump will be able to capture this core Republican constituency, because some leading evangelicals have spoken of being disturbed by his penchant for boasting about himself and belittling others, his pledges to deport Mexican immigrants and bar Muslims from entering the country, and his past support for abortion rights and gay rights. Some influential evangelical leaders have joined the “Never Trump” camp, while others have pledged support for Mr. Trump. More came on board after he wooed about 1, 000 of them in a   meeting in New York. “Trump is not a true believer in any sense, both religiously and on the issues, but he's speaking to them,” said J. Tobin Grant, a professor of political science at Southern Illinois   and a columnist at the Religion News Service. “He's actively courting them, and that's what the activists want. They want to have a seat at the table, and they felt they didn't have that with Romney. ” The poll also found that Roman Catholics favored Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, over Mr. Trump by 17 percentage points  —   a significant shift from the 2012 presidential race, when Election Day exit polls showed Catholics split almost evenly between Mr. Romney and the Democratic incumbent, President Obama. The change is largely because of the support of Hispanic Catholics, who make up about   of Roman Catholics in the United States and favor Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by an overwhelming 77 percent to 16 percent. White Catholics narrowly favor Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, 50 to 46 percent, but Mrs. Clinton has a   advantage among all Catholics who say they attend Mass weekly. Black Protestants are firmly in Mrs. Clinton's camp, and white mainline Protestants favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, 50 to 39 percent. The survey did not show results for members of minority religious groups, like Buddhists, Hindus, Jews and Muslims, because there were not enough of them in the poll. The survey found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump decisively in a   contest, 51 to 42 percent. Mrs. Clinton has solid support from voters who claim no religion  —   a cohort known as the “nones,” according to the poll. This group has grown rapidly in recent years, and now makes up about   of registered voters  —   about the same share of the electorate as white evangelicals. Religiously unaffiliated voters back Mrs. Clinton by 68 percent to 26 percent, but their support is softer than evangelicals' support for Mr. Trump. The poll found that 36 percent of white evangelicals said they strongly supported Mr. Trump, while in June 2012, just 26 percent said they strongly supported Mr. Romney. Mr. Romney faced resistance from some evangelicals because of his Mormon faith. Mr. Trump is a member of the Presbyterian Church U. S. A. a liberal mainline Protestant denomination, has demonstrated little fluency in the Bible or Christianity, and has said that he has never asked God for forgiveness. But the poll showed that voters in general, including evangelicals, were dissatisfied with their options this year.   percent of white evangelical voters said it would be difficult to choose between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton because “neither one” would make a good president. In fact, the survey found that the desire to defeat Mrs. Clinton was the prime reason evangelicals supported Mr. Trump. Of the 78 percent of white evangelicals who said they would vote for Mr. Trump, 45 percent said their decision was “mainly a vote against Clinton,” while only 30 percent said it was “mainly a vote for Trump. ”",

         "Exclusive — New Web Ad Targets Paul Ryan's Obamacare 2.0, Questions If Republicans Will Keep Promise to Repeal - Breitbart",
         "Matthew Boyle",
         "A new web ad from Americans for Limited Government is questioning whether House Speaker Paul Ryan and his allies in key House committees will continue supporting Obamacare 2. 0, or if they will withdraw the bill and support a full repeal of Obamacare as they promised for years they will do. [The ad, from the top conservative group, opens with video of Obamacare lies from former President Barack Obama.  “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,” Obama says in the open of the ad, one of the most infamous Obamacare lies. Then, a narrator comes on and says: “We all know Obamacare was a lie. But what are Republicans going to do about it? They voted against this law for years, using their opposition to amass power and influence in Washington. Now there's a real leader in the White House ready to repeal Obamacare now. Will Republicans respect the will of the people?” Then the video cuts to Ryan, whose Obamacare 2. 0 bill “The American Health Care Act” does not fulfill that promise, of saying: “We will keep our promise to the people. ” The narrator comes back on, and says: “They better respect the people. Repeal Obamacare now. ” The only way for Republicans to keep their promise to the people is for Ryan to withdraw the bill and go with an actual repeal of Obamacare, says Americans for Limited Government president Rick Manning. “It is catastrophic and disappointing that House GOP Leadership along with Chairmen Brady and Walden are pretending that their proposal is an Obamacare repeal, when it fails to even reach the minimum repeal standard passed by Congress in 2015 and vetoed by then President Obama,” Manning said in statement exclusive to Breitbart News. “Congressional Republicans have been entrusted with leadership largely due to their   promise to repeal Obamacare, the Ryancare bill accepts the underlying principles of the failed health care law, and attempts to fix it. The Ryan bill is indefensible both from a policy and political perspective. ” Manning told Breitbart News that this video was put forward to remind Republicans   of their promise, and to show them they should not hitch their wagon to Ryan's bill that fails to deliver on what they promised their constituents. Manning said that if Republicans fall in line behind Ryan's bill, Nancy Pelosi —  the House Democratic minority leader —  will win back the majority and be Speaker again. “Americans for Limited Government produced this video to remind Republicans of their promise to repeal all of Obamacare,” Manning said. “It is crazy for the GOP to try to go back to the American people and tell them that the rules of Congress prohibited them from   state based health care solutions, and instead they should be happy with a mutant national health care plan. For the first time in six years, Nancy Pelosi sees a pathway to holding the Speaker's gavel again, ironically through the GOP's planned failure to keep their Obamacare repeal promise that defeated her in 2010. ” Manning also called on President Trump to protect himself from the Ryan bill and all of the fallout it will cause. “President Donald Trump needs to take a step back from the Ryancare abyss and listen to those of us who supported him,” Manning, a strong supporter of the president, said. “This legislation must be retooled to rip all of Obamacare out by the roots, followed by a replacement bill that respects the American people and the Constitution by returning authority over health care to the states. ” Americans for Limited Government joins a number of other Republican groups —  and medical associations and groups like the AARP —  in opposition to the Obamacare 2. 0 bill from Ryan.",

         "Mike Pence Disavows Donald Trump's Earlier Proposal Barring Muslims - The New York Times",
         "Alan Rappeport",
         "The Trump campaign appeared to disavow one of its most provocative policy proposals on Thursday, as Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana said explicitly that Donald J. Trump no longer wanted to impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. In a round of television interviews in which he was asked to clarify once and for all where the campaign stands on the proposal, Mr. Pence, who opposed the ban before becoming Mr. Trump's running mate, declared the idea dead. The reversal is a significant one for the Trump campaign, which was accused of promoting a policy that was discriminatory and probably unconstitutional when Mr. Trump unveiled it in the name of national security last year. Asked on CNN about why he will not condemn the Muslim ban now, Mr. Pence said, “Because that's not Donald Trump's position now. ” In recent months, Mr. Trump has changed how he has talked about the ban, saying that “extreme vetting” of immigrants should be focused on people coming from countries that have been compromised by terrorists. But that idea led to more confusion, because it was not clear if it was an expansion of the Muslim ban or a shift away from it. Mr. Pence appeared to imply in August that he would be open to broadening the ban to other religions, but the emphasis was placed on geography. “That's what Donald Trump and I are calling for now, is to have a temporary suspension of immigration from countries or territories compromised by terrorism, and I believe that's an appropriate action given the horrendous, horrendous violence that we see,” Mr. Pence told Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin talk radio host, at the time. Historians have compared Mr. Trump's Muslim ban to some of the darkest moments in American history, likening it to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the use of internment camps for   during World War II. The timing of Mr. Pence's latest remarks may not be a coincidence. Polls have shown a majority of Americans oppose the concept of barring Muslims, while Republicans remain divided about it. The retreat on Thursday was the latest example of the Trump campaign changing a position as the election approaches. Mr. Trump recently softened his position on immigration, forgoing his calls for mass deportation in favor of a focus on “criminal aliens. ” Mr. Pence was also one of the first members of the campaign to publicly acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, paving the way for Mr. Trump to finally end his false conspiracy theory about Mr. Obama's birthplace last month. During the   debate this week, Mr. Pence brushed off many of Mr. Trump's startling comments from the campaign, disregarding some as reflecting a lack of political polish and denying that others were ever said. But critics of Mr. Trump are not letting his campaign off the hook for the Muslim ban so easily. “Governor Pence's flagrant attempts to mislead voters on his running mate's positions aren't fooling anyone,” said Zara Rahim, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign. “Not only has Trump proposed an unconstitutional immigration ban on an entire religion, but he's suggested creating a database that tracks Muslims in this country. ” She added, “Pence has not disavowed anything, he's just lied to the American people once again. ” Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on   Relations, said that Mr. Trump could not simply turn the page on the Muslim ban. “Whatever the Trump campaign claims is the current version of its Muslim ban, the original absolutist language of a ‘total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States'  —   along with other bigoted statements  —   reflect a systematic and toxic use of Islamophobia that has had a tremendously harmful impact on the lives of ordinary American Muslims and on the unity of our nation,” Mr. Awad said. Despite efforts to quietly backtrack on the proposal, the Trump campaign has continued to face questions about the ban because the news release from last December announcing the proposal has not been removed from Mr. Trump's website. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,” the release said. But in a separate interview on MSNBC on Thursday, Mr. Pence made clear that the Muslim ban was no longer on the table. Such a proposal, he seemed to suggest, would be absurd. “So not a ban on all Muslims?” Joe Scarborough, the host of “Morning Joe,” asked Mr. Pence. “Of course not,” Mr. Pence replied.",

Trump signed the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act, a bill to help streamline benefits for disabled officers and the families of fallen officers. “For too long, injured officers have suffered, and the children of fallen officers have put their dreams of college on hold while bureaucracy delayed crucial benefits, made it impossible for their families,” Trump said. “No longer. It's unacceptable, and it's going to end today. ” Trump also signed the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, a bill allowing federal grants to help military veterans transition to careers in law enforcement. “America is proud of our veterans, and I think I can say a double proud or a triple proud,” he said. Referring to his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, Trump joked that the two bills he signed Friday were “slightly less controversial than yesterday. ” Several members of the law enforcement community joined Trump in the Diplomatic Reception Room for the signing ceremony, including representatives from the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. Law enforcement officers from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Virginia were also present. “When a home is threatened, when danger visits our doorstep, when innocent lives are on the line, Americans turn to their courageous officers of law enforcement because we know they are here to serve and to protect us all,” Trump said, thanking them.",

         "The FBI Can't Actually Investigate a Candidate Such as Hillary Clinton",
         null,
         "Eric ZUESSE | 05.11.2016 | OPINION The FBI Can't Actually Investigate a Candidate Such as Hillary Clinton The power above the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the US Attorney General, and, above that person, the US President. That's whom the FBI actually serves — not the US public. This is the reason why the FBI is having such internal tensions and dissensions over the investigation of Hillary Clinton: Not only is she the current President's ardently preferred and designated successor — and overwhelmingly supported also by America's aristocracy and endorsed by the aristocracy's press — but the top leadership of the FBI have terms-in-office that (unlike, for example, the term of the US Attorney General) do not end with the installation of the next President; and these people will therefore be serving, quite possibly, the very same person whom they are now ‘investigating'. This is the reason why James Comey, the FBI's Director, let Clinton totally off the hook on July 5th, when he declined to present the case to a grand jury: he and the rest of the FBI's top management violated three basic principles of trying white-collar-crime cases when a prosecutor is serious about wanting to prosecute and obtain a conviction against a person — he (and they) wanted to keep their jobs, not be fighting their boss and their likely future boss. If America were an authentic democracy, there would be a way for the FBI to serve the public even when the US President doesn't want it to. According to the only scientific study that has ever been done of the matter, the US federal government is a dictatorship not a democracy. This was reluctantly reported by the researchers, whose own careers are dependent upon the aristocracy which they were finding actually controls that government. They found that the US, at the federal level, is not a democracy but an «oligarchy», by which the researchers were referring to an «economic elite», America's billionaires and centi-millionaires who control America's international corporations and the ‘charities' (such as think tanks) that are dependent upon them — including many that directly affect US politics, such as the think tanks or other way-stations for former US government employees to become hired by private firms. The authors of the only empirical scientific research-study that has been done of whether the United States is a democracy , or instead a dictatorship, excluded the very term «aristocracy» (or «collective dictatorship» such as an «economic elite» is if that «elite» actually is in control of the given nation's government) from their article. They did this so as for the meaning not to be clear to the US public. In any country in the modern world where an aristocracy exists, aristocrats nowadays try to hide their power, not (like in former eras) display their power by crowns and other public symbols of ‘the nobility'. The closest the study's authors came to using that term, «aristocracy», was their only sentence that employed the pejorative term for an aristocracy, «oligarchy». That obscure lone sentence was: «Jeffrey Winters has posited a comparative theory of ‘Oligarchy,' in which the wealthiest citizens — even in a 'civil oligarchy' like the United States — dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth and income protection.11\" Their 11th footnote made clear that they were referring here to the book Oligarchy , by Jeffrey A. Winters, which stated the ‘theory' that this article had actually just confirmed in the American case. Their article mentioned the book — and the «oligarchy» — only in this one footnote, so that the authors of the article (whose own careers are dependent upon America's ‘oligarchs') won't be able to be accused by oligarchs (or in any way thought by their own financial benefactors — America's aristocrats) to have called the US an «oligarchy» (a collective dictatorship by the few super-rich and their agents). To apply either term — «aristocracy» or «oligarchy» — to one's own country, is now viewed as negative, an insult to the country's controlling elite. Neither scholars nor scholarly publishers wish to insult the people who ultimately are their top funders. This article was written in the standard unnecessarily obscurantist style of social ‘scientists' who want to be comprehensible only to their peers and not to the general public. Doing it this way is safer for them, because it makes extremely unlikely that their own benefactors would retaliate, against them or else against the institutions that hire them, by withdrawing their continued financial and promotional support (such as by no longer having them invited onto CNN as an «expert»). (This type of fear prevents theory in the social ‘sciences' from being strictly based upon the given field's empirical findings: it's not authentically scientific. The physical sciences are far less corrupt, far more scientific. The biological sciences are in-between.) One particular reason why the authors never called the people who control the US government an «aristocracy», is that everyone knows that the Founders of the US were opposed to, and were engaged in overthrowing, the existing aristocracy, which happened to be British, and that they even banned forever in the US the use of aristocratic titles, such as «Lord» or «Sir.» Consequently, within the US, the only term that the aristocrats consider acceptable to refer to aristocrats, is «oligarchs», which always refers only to aristocrats in foreign countries, and so is considered safe by the aristocrats' writers (including scholars and political pundits) to use. Everyone knows: in accord with the clear intention of America's Founders , the US should eliminate from its citizenry any aristocrat (any self-enclosed and legally immune group that holds power over the government), but Americans naturally accept the existence of «oligarchs» in other countries (and «good-riddance to them there»), typically the ones in countries US foreign policy opposes and often overthrows by means of coup or outright military invasion (any form of conquest, such as in 2003 Iraq, or 2011 Libya). It's fine to refer to other countries' aristocracies as ‘oligarchies', because any such foreign aristocracy can therefore be declared to be bad and ‘deserving' of overthrow. Thus, any aristocracy that is opposed to America's aristocracy (especially one that's opposed to being controlled by the US aristocracy), and which wants to be controlling instead their own independent nation, can acceptably be overthrown by coup (such as Ukraine 2014 was) or invasion (such as Libya 2011 was). Thus, calling a foreign aristocracy an «oligarchy» is supportive of, not opposed to, the US aristocracy — and, so, «oligarchy» is the term the authors used (on that one occasion, and they never used the prohibited term «aristocracy»). Nonetheless, despite the cultural ban on describing the US as an «aristocracy», the authors were — as obscurely as they were able — proving that the US is an aristocracy, no authentic democracy at all. Or, again, as they said it in their least-obscurantist phrasing of it: « Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans — though useful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases — is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater». ‘Greater' than what? They didn't say. That's because what they were saying (as obscurely as possible) is that it's probably ‘greater' than is shown in the data that was publicly available to them, and upon which data their clear finding is that the US is an aristocracy, no democracy at all. Or, as they also put it: \"Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis.» But, actually, «Economic Elite Domination theories» (virtually all of which come down to positing an aristocracy that consists of the billionaires — and centi-millionaires — and their corporations, and their think tanks, and their lobbyists, etc.) did phenomenally well, in their findings, not just ‘rather well'— they simply can't safely say this. Saying it is samizdat, in the US dictatorship. They were allowed to prove it, but not to say it. So, that's what they did. They didn't want to «upset the applecart» from which they themselves are feeding. The simplest (but no less accurate) way of stating their finding is: the US, at least during the period the researchers probed, which was 1981-2002, was an aristocracy, no democracy at all. The US, in other words, was (even prior to the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which is making the aristocracy even more concentrated among even fewer people) a country of men (and women — that's to say, of individuals ) not of laws; it's a dictatorship, in short; it is not a country «of laws, not of men» . America's Founders have finally lost. The country has been taken over by an aristocracy. And one of those «men» now, is actually Hillary Clinton, even though she is no longer officially holding governmental power. They know she soon might be. That's why, the FBI cannot really, and seriously, investigate her. It's not for legal reasons at all. It's because of whom she is. In fact, purely on the basis of US laws, she clearly ought to be in prison . Any honest lawyer, inside or outside the FBI, has long known this, because the actual case against her is ‘slam-dunk' , even though the FBI has refused to investigate it and has limited its ‘investigation' only to peripheral ‘national security' issues. (The #2 person at FBI, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, right below Director James Comey, specified this limitation to his ‘investigators'. They simply weren't allowed to investigate her, except on the hardest-to-prove crimes that she probably but not definitely did also do. The slam-dunks were just off-limits to them. McCabe's wife's political campaign had received $675,000 from the PAC of Terry McAuliffe , a close friend of the Clintons, who chaired Hillary's 2008 Presidential campaign. And, even on the harder-to-prove matters, which FBI Director Comey declined on July 5th to pursue, they stood a strong chance of winning, if only Comey hadn't prevented their moving forward to try — but those issues are tangential to the basic case against her, anyway.) There are at least six federal criminal laws which accurately and unquestionably describe even what Ms. Clinton has now publicly admitted having done by her privatized email system, and intent isn't even mentioned in most of them nor necessary in order for her to be convicted — the actions themselves convict her, and the only relevance that intent might have, regarding any of these laws, would be in determining how long her prison sentence would be. I have already presented the texts of these six laws (and you can see the sentences for each one, right there), and any reader can easily recognize that each one of them describes, unambiguously without any doubt, what she now admits having done . Most of these crimes don't require any intent in order to convict (and the ones that do require intent are only «knowingly … conceals», or else «with the intent to impair the object's … use in an official proceeding», both of which «intents» would be easy to prove on the basis of what has already been made public — but others of these laws don't require even that); and none of them requires any classified information to have been involved, at all. It's just not an issue in these laws. Thus, conviction under them is far easier. If a prosecutor is really seeking to convict someone, he'll be aiming to get indictments on the easiest-to-prove charges, first. That also presents for the prosecutor the strongest position in the event of an eventual plea-bargain. As Alan Dershowitz said , commenting on one famous prosecution: «They also wanted a slam-dunk case. They wanted the strongest possible case.» Comey simply didn't; he wanted the hardest-to-convict case. His presentation was a brazen hoax. That's all. That's the real scandal, and nobody (other than I) has been writing about it as what it is — a hoax. But what it shows is that maybe the only way that Clinton will be able to avoid going to prison is by her going to the White House. Either she gets a term in the White House, or else she gets a (much longer) term in prison — or else our government is so thoroughly corrupt that she remains free as a private citizen and still above the law, even though not serving as a federal official. Even if she is convicted only on these six slam-dunk statutes (and on none other, including not on the ones that Comey was referring to when he said on July 5 th that, «Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case»), she could be sentenced to a maximum of 73 years in prison (73 = 5 + 5 + 20 + 20 + 3 + 10 + 10). Adding on others she might also have committed (such as the ones that Comey was referring to, all of which pertain only to the handling of classified information), would mean that her term in prison might be lengthier still, but what's important in the email case isn't that; it's to convict her on, essentially, theft and/or destruction of US government documents by means of transferring them into her private email and/or smashing hard drives. No one, not even a US federal official, can legally do that, and those six laws are specifically against it. Motive is important in Ms. Clinton's email case, because motive tells us why she was trying to hide from historians and from the public her operations as the US Secretary of State: was it because she didn't want them to know that she was selling to the Sauds and her other friends the US State Department's policies in return for their million-dollar-plus donations to the Clinton Foundation , and maybe even selling to them (and/or their cronies) US government contracts, or why? However, those are questions regarding other crimes that she might have been perpetrating while in public office, not the crimes of her privatized email operation itself ; and those other crimes (whatever they might have been) would have been explored only after an indictment on the slam-dunks, and for further possible prosecutions, if President Obama's people were serious about investigating her. They weren't. Clearly, this is selective ‘justice'. That's the type of ‘justice' an aristocracy imposes. Why, then, did Comey finally switch to re-open the Clinton case? It wasn't merely the discovery of some of her previously unknown emails on the computer of Anthony Wiener, husband to Hillary's closest aide Huma Abedin. As Politico on October 28th reported , «Another former Justice official said Comey's letter [announcing the re-opening of Hillary's case] could be part of an effort on his part to quiet internal FBI critics who viewed him as burying the Clinton probe for political reasons. ‘He's come under a lot of criticism from his own people for how he's handled this. He's trying to gain back some of their respect,' former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ‘His ability to do what he does largely depends on the respect within his own ranks.'» Joachim Hagopian at Global Research headlined on October 30th, «The Real Reasons Why FBI Director James Comey Reopened the Hillary Email Investigation» , and reported: «Former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. … Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday's interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash». In other words: Comey was between a rock (the resignation-letters piling up on his desk from subordinates who felt that no person should be above the law) and a hard place (his ability to stay on at the FBI and not have a scandal against himself bleed out to the public from down below). The US wasn't yet that kind of dictatorship — one which could withstand such a public disclosure. In order for it to become one, the aristocracy's control would have needed to be even stronger than it yet is. Also on the 30 th , Ed Klein in Britain's Daily Mail bannered : EXCLUSIVE: Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was wrong: Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation James Comey revived the investigation of Clinton's email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents, sources say The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim [Comey] announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. So, does this now mean that, finally, the FBI will bring before a grand jury the evidence that Hillary Clinton blatantly violated those six federal criminal laws against stealing and/or trying to destroy federal documents? There has never — at least since 1981 — been so severe a test of the extent to which this nation is (as those researches found it to have unquestionably been between 1981 and 2002) an «oligarchy». However, a serious criminal prosecution of Ms. Clinton would potentially start an unwinding of this dictatorship. The present writer will make no prediction. However, obviously, the results of the election on November 8th will certainly have an enormous impact upon the outcome. Since I think that anyone but a complete fool can recognize this much, I'm confident enough to assert it — a conditional about the future.",

         "Iran raps 'rare' EU clauses in trade deals Fri Oct 28, 2016 1:37PM Economy Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Iran's deputy minister of roads and urban development, has criticized “very exceptional terms and conditions” that Europeans are including in trade deals with Iran. \nA top official in Tehran has accused European government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with Iran - what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in January. \nAsghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Iran's deputy minister of roads and urban development, told the Financial Times that European government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as “very exceptional terms and conditions” in trade agreements with Iran. \nFakhrieh Kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the Iranian economy. \nHe said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as “unacceptable terms” in contracts related to “political risk” in doing business with Iran. \nFakhrieh Kashan emphasized that Iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against Iran. \nEuropean businesses, he said, are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks - what he said is totally rejected by the Islamic Republic. \nIf anyone needed guarantees against political risks, it was Iran, Fakhrieh Kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the Iranian economy. \n“Why should Iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with European companies? This is not called a normal relationship,” he said. \nFakhrieh Kashan emphasized that European countries should take the adequate measures to prevent their businesses from including political risk in contracts, warning that any failure to do so will be against the nuclear agreement with Iran. \n“This is where European countries are failing to be committed to the nuclear agreement. One of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue.” \nLast summer, Iran signed a historic deal with the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany - the so-called P5+1 group - based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities. The P5+1 in return agreed to lift certain economic sanctions imposed against the Islamic Republic. Loading ...",

         "The Death Of John Kennedy",
         "Mike Rivero",
         "WMD \nANNOUNCEMENT! \nJust a reminder that this site continues to be attacked by the crybaby hackers, so if you cannot reach it, wait a couple minutes and try again. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY! \"It is a terrible situation when the Government, to insure the National Wealth, must go in debt and submit to ruinous interest charges, at the hands of men, who control the fictitious value of gold. Interest is the invention of Satan.\" -- Thomas Edison YOUR RANDOM DHS MONITORED PHRASE OF THE DAY Chemical burn \nPaid advertising at What Really Happened may not represent the views and opinions of this website and its contributors. No endorsement of products and services advertised is either expressed or implied. \nThe Death Of John Kennedy By Michael Rivero\nThere have been two official investigations. One concluded Oswald acted alone, the other that there was a conspiracy. After half a century, many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified. John F. Kennedy's brain is still missing from the National Archives. Why, if it is an open and shut case? Why the secrecy, if Oswald was just a \"crazed lone gunman\"? \nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that John F. Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza, captured over a police radio. A total of 7 impulses were caught on the tape, but citing budgetary constraints, the HSCA only had 4 of them analyzed. The analysis concluded that all 4 were gunshots, two of them occurring within 1/2 a second of each other, too close to be fired by one man. Comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in Dealey Plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the Grassy Knoll. Needless to say, the existence of 5, rather than just 3, gunshots destroyed the Oswald as lone gunman cover-up. Warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city, and confused for Dealey Plaza shots because of a timing error. Without explaining just where the other shots had occurred, or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in Dealey Plaza, the Warren supporters declared victory. New research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed, and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in Dealey Plaza at the time of the JFK assassination. This means that the original House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion is the correct one. There were at least five gunshots in Dealey Plaza, two of them within 1/2 second of each other, and at least one of the shots came from the Grassy Knoll. UPDATE: The Deathbed Confession of CIA Agent, E. Howard Hunt to his son on the JFK Assassination. UPDATE: Numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of Kennedy's head, consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the Grassy Knoll. The Warren Commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the Grassy Knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of Kennedy's head that showed no damage. Now it has been revealed that the Warren Commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed Kennedy's head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral , as had been done with Lincoln. \nAlthough described as a mix-up, the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the Warren Commission. Dan Rather's \"fib\" \nDan Rather, at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market Texas TV station, viewed the Zapruder film, then described it to America on the CBS network. As this recording of that broadcast shows, Rather lied to all of America in claiming that the head shot pushed John F. Kennedy's head forward. \nRather makes the claim that Kennedy's head \"rocketed forward\" at 2:15 in the above video. He also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total. Rather's meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast. When the Zapruder film was finally shown publicly, during Jim Garrison's trial of CIA agent Clay Shaw, Rather's lie was revealed for all to see. A Revealing Wink \nMost Americans who lived through the Kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of Vice President Lyndon Johnson being sworn in as President aboard Air Force One. \nBut very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later! \nIn this photo, Congressman Albert Thomas winks back at the brand-new President!",

         "CT Gov. Malloy Instructs School Superintendents to Follow Obama's Transgender Bathroom Policy - Breitbart",
         "Dr. Susan Berry",
         "Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy ( ) issued an executive order Thursday instructing the state department of education to develop policies with local school districts that allow gender confused children to use the school bathrooms and locker rooms of whichever gender they identify with at any given time. [According to a press release from Malloy's office, the governor and state department of education Commissioner Dianna R. Wentzell issued a memo to all Connecticut public school superintendents, referring them to former President Barack Obama's 2016 transgender bathroom policy for guidance until more “formal guidance” is developed within the state.  Malloy's executive order is in response to President Donald Trump's decision to abandon Obama's May 2016 directive, which effectively asserts that children can change their sex by simply announcing they have the “gender identity” of the other sex. Trump essentially returned the issue of school bathrooms to the states. Obama's transgender bathroom policy was actually halted in August of 2016 by a U. S. district judge who said the former president had overstepped his authority in issuing the directive. The order comes “in light of an action yesterday by the Trump Administration to roll back federal guidelines that protected transgender students in public school,” states the press release from the governor's office. The governor said in a statement: Discrimination, harassment, and bullying have no place in our classrooms or at our schools. Despite the actions taken by the federal government yesterday, the State of Connecticut remains committed to ensuring that every student has access to a   education in a safe, supportive and welcoming school environment. Every child, no matter their gender identity or expression, should be treated equally and fairly in a safe, supportive environment. Connecticut will remain a state of inclusiveness because we strongly believe that diversity makes us stronger. Malloy, who served as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, signed legislation in 2011 that added yet another category of a special protected class  —   gender identity and expression  —   into Connecticut's   statutes. Less than   of Americans support the “ ” ideology pushed by gay activists and by Obama. Policies associated with the ideology would allow transgender activists to sue   institutions  —   such as sports leagues, public   and women's shelters   —   until both biological sexes are viewed as interchangeable. Since the presidential election, Obama has twice admitted that his unpopular transgender policy helped to defeat Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton. In an email statement, Family Institute of Connecticut (FIC) says, “[T]he governor's statement of opposition is a farce, just the typical grandstanding to his base for which he is prone. ” FIC continues: As White House spokesman Sean Spicer explained in his daily briefing, President Trump rescinded President Obama's transgender imposition on the nation's schools because “He just believes this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by the states. ” In other words, President Trump could care less whether Gov. Malloy reaffirms transgender impositions on Connecticut's schools. Trump rescinded Obama's “guidelines” for reasons of states' rights, the very idea Malloy appeals to in resisting Trump's immigration policies. On Wednesday, the Connecticut governor also ordered his state's law enforcement officers to refuse to comply with Trump's immigration orders and policies, urging them to bar federal immigration officials from having access to illegal immigrants. Additionally, Malloy's order encouraged schools to develop their own plans to bar access to schools by federal immigration officials. In June of 2016, Quinnipiac University released a survey that found Malloy's approval ratings had plummeted to 24 percent  —   his lowest since taking office in 2011, and “one of the lowest approval ratings ever recorded for a governor in any of the nine states surveyed by the Quinnipiac University Poll,” reports the school. In the same month, a study from George Mason University's Mercatus Center found that Connecticut ranked as the state in the worst fiscal condition  —   second only to Puerto Rico.",

         "Melkulangara Bhadrakumar",
         "Written by Melkulangara Bhadrakumar   The battle of Mosul has been joined, finally, as Iraqi Special Forces entered the city limits earlier today from the east. ( BBC ) The early reports suggest that the Islamic State fighters responded with guided anti-tank missiles and small arms to block the Iraqi advance. Al Jazeera reported that the battle is “intense” and IS fighters are putting up “stiff resistance” against the approaching forces.The IS has set the oil wells on fire to obscure their positions from possible air attacks. Nonetheless, US air strikes are continuing. Another Iraqi column from the south is still 35 kms away from Mosul city. To the north, Kurdish forces and Iraqi army units are approaching the city, while the Shi'ite militias are covering the western flank to cut off any escape route for the IS fighters in the direction of Syria. There is a tacit understanding that the Iran-backed Shi'ite militia known as the Popular Mobilisation Force will not enter the Sunni-dominated Mosul city.The US military estimates that there could be up to 7500 IS fighters in Mosul, including 1000 foreigners. The Iraqi forces and their Kurdish allies, Sunni tribesmen and Shia militias converging on Mosul are 40000-strong. The top US commander in Iraq Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend in a video conference last week from Baghdad had exuded optimism that “the Iraqis will be successful”. The general said: The Mosul offensive is a large and extraordinarily complex operation that the Iraqis have been planning for a very long time. They're the ones making the decisions and their forces are the ones who will enter Mosul and raise the Iraqi flag in the center of the city. We assisted them with the planning and preparation of forces and have provided advice and assistance such as air and artillery strikes and intelligence to support the Iraqi operations.A few days before Mosul operations began, I attended the Iraqis' final operational briefing where each commander responsible for a different axis of advance provided their plan to the prime minister. I can tell you that it was clear to me that night that the sovereign nation of Iraq owns this fight. There's a lot of hard fighting ahead, but we're confident the Iraqis will be successful. ( Transcript ) However, coming days may well throw up nasty surprises, when house-to-house fighting begins. In a graphic field report from Baghdad two days ago, the Xinhua correspondent had noted: IS militants appeared well-trained for urban combat, and they showed stubborn fighting when they continued sporadic clashes for two days after Friday, as the troops searched for unknown number of militants holed-up in some buildings and houses and possibly would attack again or flee the city.Heavier resistance is anticipated by some 3,000 to 5,000 IS militants once the anti-IS forces enter populated neighborhoods located on the eastern side of the Tigris River that bisects the city… IS group has evacuated most of its fighters from its headquarters in the eastern side to the western side where the old city located… The battles in the eastern side of Mosul would mainly depend on suicide car bombs, roadside bombs and snipers attacks, which aimed at hindering the progress of the troops, while the fierce battles are expected to be on the western side.Mosul is the IS last major stronghold in Iraq, the group more likely is unwilling to surrender without a fight. Over the past two and a half years, they have dug an extensive network of tunnels to transport equipment and fighters, and rigged roads and bridges with bombs and digging trenches to be filled with burning oil to impede the Iraqi forces' movements. Then there is the human toll of an estimated over one million civilians who are still living in the city, and IS apparently to use them as human shield.” ( Xinhua ) The ‘known unknown' will be as regards Turkey's role. Baghdad has resisted any Turkish involvement in the fighting, whereas, Ankara is raring to go. It is reasonably certain that at some point, Turkey will find an alibi to intervene. There are reports that tanks and armoured vehicles from the 28th Mechanized Brigade of Turkish armed forces are being deployed in the border town of Silopi on the border with Iraq. A Turkish incursion into Iraq seems to be in the making. ( Hurriyet )If Turkey enters the Battle of Mosul, all bets are off, as things can take an unexpected turn. Both Iraq and Iran (and the US and Russia) would know that Turkey has geopolitical objectives. Indeed, Turkish media is for the first time opening challenging the Lausanne Treaty of 1923 under which Britain had handed over Mosul to Iraq. President Recep Erdogan himself staked claim recently to the former Ottoman territories: “We are not happy with these borders. Our territory which was 2.5 million square kilometers in 1914 shrank to 780 thousand square kilometers nine years later, when Lausanne was signed… Those who are trying to imprison Turkey in a vicious circle since 1923 want to erase our thousand-year history in this region.”Clearly, so much remains in the womb of time. The Arab world will feel uneasy if and when Turkey begins to reclaim former Ottoman territories. An incredibly complex situation is unfolding as the contestation over Mosul's post-IS future begins.

         "CEDARHURST, N. Y.  —   On a brisk October day, Laura Gentile strolled through the orderly aisles stocked with matzo ball soup, apple juice, challah and cinnamon kokosh cake. Packing her cart with fresh peppers, canned tuna, pretzels and cake, she said the food pantry here on Long Island was the first where she felt like any other grocery shopper. It was welcome relief from the long lines and piles of unorganized food at other food banks. “You don't feel destroyed just walking in,” Ms. Gentile, 45, said. “Renee greets you when you come in, and you can pick out what you want, what you need. You're not just handed something. ” Renee Harris, the food pantry coordinator, said she knew from experience the importance of creating a welcoming environment. When her husband lost his job in 2009, she found herself shopping at food banks for the first time in her life. “I felt the employees watching me  —   like I might try to steal something,” Ms. Harris said. “And I ran out of the store crying. ” Then one day she stopped by the Rina Shkolnik Kosher Food Pantry. When her family got back on its feet a few years later, Ms. Harris started working there, hoping to replicate her experience for the 350 families who shop at the pantry each month. Emulating a traditional grocery store, the food bank is organized by food groups. Shoppers carry items home in marked bags donated by nearby shops. Ms. Gentile receives $182 a month in food stamps to feed herself, a    son, Malliki Outlaw, and a    daughter, Nevaeh Outlaw, who both have mental illnesses, she said. Once a month, she fills her cart with food from the pantry, a program of the Marion  Aaron Gural J. C. C. a beneficiary of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Having groceries in the refrigerator has made a difference in a home filled with difficulty, she said. At 19, Ms. Gentile and her young son were living with her parents, who she said had forced her to get an abortion when she became pregnant again as a condition for staying under their roof. She later moved out and became pregnant again while in an abusive relationship, she said, and gave birth to Malliki. Months later, she found out she was expecting twins. Two months along, she miscarried one of them. She named the surviving twin Nevaeh  —   heaven spelled backward. Abuse marks Ms. Gentile's body. A white scar runs along her hand  —   the lasting effect of being stabbed by a sharp piece of plastic. She has also endured mental trauma. Ms. Gentile said she had lost count of the number of times her children had been hospitalized or institutionalized, because of the harm they were causing their mother and themselves. But she said the trouble had started after their father died in 2002. Ms. Gentile takes care of both children, who still live at home. Her son has bipolar disorder, and her daughter has anxiety, depression and mild intellectual disabilities. She said that medication and therapy had helped manage their symptoms, and that they had not been hospitalized since 2009. But Ms. Gentile's own health problems, including depression, high blood pressure and arthritis, exacerbated by years of abuse, have worsened. She had an operation to remove her ovaries because of a precancerous cyst. Doctors have told her that she needs to have gallstones removed and both knees replaced, but she cannot afford the operations and fears leaving her children for the duration of the recovery without another caregiver. Injections would ease the pain in her arthritic knees, but her insurance does not cover the cost. Ms. Gentile, who worked as a medical office assistant and coordinator for a physical therapy clinic, stopped working in 2008 and started receiving Supplemental Security Income a year later. The family now subsists on a cumulative $1, 434 in Supplemental Security Income. The family's benefits had previously been cut by $733 when her son's Supplemental Security benefits were terminated in April, because proper documentation was not submitted. The benefits were reinstated this month but reduced by $30. In 2009 she moved from Queens Village to Far Rockaway in Queens. She sleeps on a makeshift bed and gives her children the two bedrooms. After a public housing subsidy, she pays $410 a month for rent. Marion  Aaron Gural J. C. C. provided Ms. Gentile and her children with $630 from the Neediest Cases Fund to cover her December 2015 rent and $650 to help with rent again in September. At the food pantry, Ms. Gentile walked to the front to check out. Ms. Harris warmly pointed out a bag of grapes, adding it and a few other items to Ms. Gentile's cart. She reminded her to return in a few weeks for a Thanksgiving turkey. As Ms. Gentile left, grocery bags in both hands, she was smiling.",

         "Speaker At Trump Rally Says He Hopes Hillary Clinton Dies In A Fiery Car Crash (VIDEO) By Andrew Bradford on October 30, 2016 Subscribe \nWhen historians write accounts of the 2016 race for the White House, it's very likely that one of the things which will get special attention is the level of violence-both physical and verbal-which has emanated from those who slavishly support GOP nominee Donald Trump. \nIf you doubt this fact, consider what was said earlier today at a Trump rally being held in Las Vegas. Author and self-described “capitalist evangelist” Wayne Allyn Root was giving a rambling speech as a warm-up before Der Fuhrer Donald took the stage, and while portions of it were comparable to the rantings of Charles Manson after too much caffeine, it was the language Root used (highly militaristic and warlike) that you cannot help but notice. At various points in his unhinged diatribe, Root used the following phrases : “Trump warriors” “Trump army” “Trump revolution” \nThen, in full psychotic rant, Root attempted to mix together plot elements from the O.J. Simpson case with the movies Driving Miss Daisy and Thelma and Louise , telling the ecstatic crowd : “It's Hillary in a White Ford Bronco. She's got Huma driving and they're headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. It's called Driving Miss Hillary. And the ending, if we all get our wish, is like Thelma and Louise!” \nFinally, Root ended his echo of Nuremberg by declaring: “I will give you my country when you pry it from my cold dead hands.” \nWhen I listen to Wayne Allyn Root (or any of the other fanatical Trumpkins), the movie that comes to mind for me is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \nFeatured Image Via Right Wing Watch About Andrew Bradford \nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

         "Video! Five Times Venezuela's Dictator Maduro Danced on TV While the Country Burned",
         "Frances Martel",
         "Venezuela's dictator Nicolás Maduro has plenty of problems on his plate  —   soaring   food and medicine shortages, the surging popularity of the opposition movement against him  —   and this year he has delivered at least one concrete plan to solve them: dancing. [Maduro, a former bus driver who served as his predecessor Hugo Chávez's foreign minister, has long enjoyed using his television program In Contact with Maduro to broadcast his dance moves. As the current crisis in Venezuela intensified, however  —   with a ceaseless wave of protests beginning a month ago, in response to Maduro's Supreme Court's attempt to dissolve the National Assembly and install itself as the national legislative body  —   Maduro has appeared dancing on Venezuela's airwaves with increasing frequency.  Below are five times this year  —   four times this month!  —   that the head of state of one of the world's most volatile nations danced on television while his people demanded his ouster: May 3: Dance Celebration of Move to Draft a New Constitution, Narnia VS Venezuela pic. twitter.   —   Yusnaby Pérez (@Yusnaby) May 3, 2017,  On Wednesday, Maduro appeared before the National Election Center (CNE) to formally demand the establishment of a “Constituents' Assembly,” which would draft laws in lieu of the   National Assembly and create a new national constitution from scratch. To celebrate his power move, Maduro danced before the head of the CNE on television, flanked by   officials. One video of this dance went viral on social media: a video apparently taken in Caracas of a television broadcast of Maduro's dance, which then pivots from the television to the window, where armored tanks are visibly confronting unarmed protesters below: April 26: “Everyone Must Know How to Dance” During a national event last week, Maduro mandated that all Venezuelans dance as part of a political effort to construct a greater socialism. “The youth of the Revolution must know how to sing, love, and dance to construct a peaceful and happy Revolution,” he decreed. “We must all dance. Whoever does not know how needs to learn. ” The comments appeared to be part of a promotion of a new dance initiative meant to distract students from protesting Maduro's government, which he had announced that week: April 23: The “Salsa and Urban Heart” Initiative to Bolster the Bolivarian Revolution, Maduro announced that initiative on Sundays with Maduro, his weekly television program. The initiative is meant to channel youth energy into frivolous dancing, rather than organizing an   movement on the streets. The nation's student population has been at the heart of the opposition protests, as young Venezuelans who have lived most of their lives under socialism have largely rejected the destruction of their country under Chávez and Maduro. Maduro announced that the initiative was intended to provide opportunities to young students to “express themselves” in a healthy way. While the head of state typically dances salsa in public  —   he loves the genre so much he also hosts a radio program called Salsa Time  —   in this video, he attempted to dance to   music along with breakdancers: April 21: Dancing in Lab Coats,  On April 21, Maduro appeared on television wearing a lab coat and what appears to be a stethoscope dancing salsa with his wife, legislator Cilia Flores. This particular episode of his weekly program elicited severe criticism over Maduro's mockery of the protesters, including a man who confronted an armored tank wearing nothing and holding a Bible and protesters who were forced to flee into a toxic sewer to avoid being attacked by military tear gas canisters in Caracas: February 18: Patriotic Congress of Youth Dance, Thursday afternoon in Caracas, and Maduro declares the start of Carnival  …    . pic. twitter.   —   Nathan Crooks (@nmcrooks) February 16, 2017,  In a less recent episode that appeared to embarrass his vice president, the   “drug kingpin” Tareck El Aissami, Maduro appeared on television to celebrate a socialist youth assembly meant to bolster loyalty for his dictatorship. Amid the celebration, Maduro announced the start of the national Carnival festivities. “We declare the launch of Carnival and we are going into the streets to dance,” he announced before the music began and he did as he promised.

         "Leave a reply \nNick Hodge - The theme of all things “Outsider” has cropped up once more. \nThis time in the form of the election of Donald Trump to the White House — the first such electee with neither political nor military experience. A true Outsider. \nThe New York Times captured it perfectly if unintentionally in an article today: Journalists, it said “portrayed Trump supporters as out of touch with reality. In the end, it was the other way around.” \nThe Establishment is out of touch with reality. No one told them being an Outsider was in. \nAs well, no one told them that, despite their Fed-induced papered-over recovery in which 95% of the wealth gained in the U.S. since 2009 went to the top 1%, most of the country is utterly pissed off. \nThat's what you saw last night: high turnout of the pissed off vote. \nPissed off at all the things we've covered in these pages for years: - Political payola - Continued bank scandals with no prosecution - Incessant war - No wage growth (over half of full-time workers make $30k or less) - Complete civilian surveillance - General ‘above the law' attitude of elites \nHillary Clinton was a true poster girl of the Establishment, and the election easily became a referendum on it and her rather than anything else. \nDonald Trump didn't win. The Establishment lost. \nI say this not as a Trump supporter. Indeed, I voted for Gary Johnson. \nRather, I'm simply pointing out that, as they have been for years, Outsiders are now rising up. They, and their ideas. \nThere's still much further to go, of course, for America to get back on track. But I truly view the election of an Outsider as one small step in the right direction. \nAt least the general electorate is finally repudiating the status quo. \nThe years ahead are going to be interesting — politically, economically, and financially.

         "Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30? - The New York Times",
         "Alex Williams",
         "Editor's note: This article first ran on July 13, 2012, but we're running it again because the topic is timeless. IT was like one of those magical   scenes out of a Hollywood   without the “rom. ” I met Brian, a New York screenwriter, a few years ago through work, which led to dinner with our wives and friend chemistry that was instant and obvious. We liked the same songs off Dylan's “Blonde on Blonde,” the same lines from “Chinatown. ” By the time the green curry shrimp had arrived, we were finishing each other's sentences. Our wives were forced to cut in: “Hey, guys, want to come up for air?” As Brian and his wife wandered off toward the No. 2 train afterward, it crossed my mind that he was the kind of guy who might have ended up a groomsman at my wedding if we had met in college. That was four years ago. We've seen each other four times since. We are “friends,” but not quite friends. We keep trying to get over the hump, but life gets in the way. Our story is not unusual. In your 30s and 40s, plenty of new people enter your life, through work, children's play dates and, of course, Facebook. But actual close friends  —   the kind you make in college, the kind you call in a crisis  —   those are in shorter supply. As people approach midlife, the days of youthful exploration, when life felt like one big blind date, are fading. Schedules compress, priorities change and people often become pickier in what they want in their friends. No matter how many friends you make, a sense of fatalism can creep in: the period for making B. F. F. 's, the way you did in your teens or early 20s, is pretty much over. It's time to resign yourself to situational friends: K. O. F. 's (kind of friends)  —   for now. But often, people realize how much they have neglected to restock their pool of friends only when they encounter a big life event, like a move, say, or a divorce. That thought struck Lisa Degliantoni, an educational   executive in Chicago, a few months ago when she was planning her 39th birthday party. After a move from New York to Evanston, Ill. she realized that she had 857 Facebook friends and 509 Twitter followers, but still did not know if she could fill her party's invitation list. “I did an inventory of the phases of my life where I've managed to make the most friends, and it was definitely high school and my first job,” she said. After a divorce in his 40s, Robert Glover, a psychotherapist in Bellevue, Wash. realized that his roster of friends had quietly atrophied for years as he focused on career and family. “All of a sudden, with your wife out of the picture, you realize you're lonely,” said Dr. Glover, now 56. “I'd go to salsa lessons. Instead of trying to pick up the women, I'd introduce myself to the men: ‘Hey, let's go get a drink.' ” In studies of peer groups, Laura L. Carstensen, a psychology professor who is the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity in California, observed that people tended to interact with fewer people as they moved toward midlife, but that they grew closer to the friends they already had. Basically, she suggests, this is because people have an internal alarm clock that goes off at big life events, like turning 30. It reminds them that time horizons are shrinking, so it is a point to pull back on exploration and concentrate on the here and now. “You tend to focus on what is most emotionally important to you,” she said, “so you're not interested in going to that cocktail party, you're interested in spending time with your kids. ” As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity repeated, unplanned interactions and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added. In the professional world, “proximity” is hard to maintain, as work colleagues are reassigned or move on to new jobs. Last year, Erica Rivinoja, a writer on the NBC series “Up All Night,” became close with a woman, Jen, when they worked together on a pilot. Almost instantly, they knew each other's exercise schedules and food preferences. Jen could sense when Ms. Rivinoja needed a jolt of caffeine, and without asking would be there with an iced tea. “But as soon as the pilot was over, it was hard to be as close without that constant    interaction,” said Ms. Rivinoja, 35. They can occasionally carve out time for a quick gin and tonic, she said, but “there aren't those long afternoons which bleed into evenings hanging out at the beach and then heading to a bar. ” The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues, Dr. Adams said. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins. Differences in professional status and income also complicate matters. “It really does get weird when your friends are making tons more than you, or tons less,” said Adriane Duckworth, a former marketing executive now working as an artist in Hamilton, Ontario. She recently welcomed a promising new couple into her circle of friends, but they quickly turned people off with their obsession with money. “At our wedding, other friends of ours who were seated with them actually complained to us afterward about the couple who was asking everyone how much money they made,” said Ms. Duckworth, 32. “People who made less felt uncomfortable discussing it, and people who made the same or more just felt it was weird to talk about it so nonchalantly. ” Once people start coupling up, the challenges only increase. Making friends with other couples “is like matchmaking for two,” said Kara Baskin, a journalist who works in Boston. “Not only are you worrying about whether the other woman likes you, you're also worrying if her husband likes you, if your husband likes her, if your husband likes him. ” Not long ago, she invited her husband's new work buddy over for dinner with his wife. But the wife was visibly unimpressed by Ms. Baskin's   home (they had just moved in) and   spaghetti dinner. “It was basically clear that his wife had been cajoled into attending,” said Ms. Baskin, 33. “She settled on to our rickety Ikea kitchen chairs like she was lowering herself into a coal mine. ” The couple departed quickly after dessert. The next day at work, the husband made an excuse about his wife being tired. “But it was unspoken that we wouldn't be seeking their company again,” Ms. Baskin said. ADDING children to the mix muddles things further. Suddenly, you are surrounded by a new circle of parent friends  —   but the emotional ties can be tenuous at best, as the comedian Louis C. K. related in one   routine: “I spend whole days with people, I'm like, I never would have hung out with you, I didn't choose you. Our children chose each other. Based on no criteria, by the way. They're the same size. ” Even when parent friends develop a bond, the resulting friendships can be fleeting  —   and subject to the whims of the children themselves. Caryl Lyons, an event planner in Danville, Calif. and her husband found a budding friendship with a   couple hit a roadblock when their young sons, who had been close friends, drifted apart. When the families planned a barbecue together, her son would say, “Can I have my other friends over?” said Ms. Lyons, 44. External factors are not the only hurdle. After 30, people often experience internal shifts in how they approach friendship.   gives way to   so you become pickier about whom you surround yourself with, said Marla Paul, the author of the 2004 book “The Friendship Crisis: Finding, Making, and Keeping Friends When You're Not a Kid Anymore. ” “The bar is higher than when we were younger and were willing to meet almost anyone for a margarita,” she said. Manipulators, drama queens, egomaniacs: a lot of them just no longer make the cut. Thayer Prime, a    strategy consultant who lives in London, has even developed a playful   scale (100 being “best friend forever”). In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior. Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance. “You meet someone really nice, but if they don't return a call, drop to 90, if they don't return two calls, that's an immediate 50,” she said. “If they're late to something in the first month, that's another 10 off. ” (But people can move up the scale with nice behavior, too, she added.) Having been hardened by experience, many people develop a more fatalistic view of friendship. “When you're younger, you define what it really means to be friends in a more serious way,” said my screenwriter friend, Brian. (His full name is Brian Koppelman, and he wrote and is a   of “Solitary Man,” a 2010 film starring Michael Douglas about a   man trying to reconnect with friends and family.) “My ideas of friendship were built by ‘The Godfather' and ‘Diner,' ” he said. “Your friends were your brothers, and anything but total loyalty at all costs meant excommunication. As you get older, that model becomes unrealistic. ” By that point, you have been through your share of wearying or failed relationships. You have come to grips with the responsibilities of juggling work, family and existing friends, so you become more wary about making yourself emotionally available to new people. “You're more keenly aware of the downside,” said Mr. Koppelman, 46. “You're also more keenly aware of your own capacity to disappoint. ” “I haven't really changed my standards for what it means to actually be friends,” he concluded. “It's just that I use the word ‘friends' more loosely. Making the real kind, the brother kind, is much harder now. ” Some, like Ms. Degliantoni, the   executive, simply downsize their expectations. “I take an extremely efficient approach and seek out   folks to fill very specific needs,” she said of her current strategy. “I have a cocktail friend and a book friend and a parenting friend and several basketball friends and a neighbor friend and a workout friend. ” “It's much easier filling in those gaps in my life,” she added, “than doing an exhaustive approach for a new friend. ” Or, they hit rock bottom and turn back the clock to their breathlessly social 20s. After a move to New York in his 30s, Dave Cervini, a radio station executive, was so lonely that he would walk his cat in Central Park, hoping to stoke conversations. Finding only curious stares, he decided to start the New York Social Network, an activities group for people to find friends by hanging out at Yankees games or   mixers. The company now counts 2, 000 members, most in their 30s. He considers 200 of them close friends. “It takes courage for people to take the first step,” he said. “Hopefully, I make it easier, having been there myself. ”  In that spirit, I recently called Brian. We joked about our inability to find time to hang out, and made a dinner date at the next available opening. It is three months from now.",

         "Benjamin Gilman, a New York Congressman for 30 Years, Dies at 94 - The New York Times",
         "Joseph P. Fried",
         "Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York congressman for 30 years and a leading Republican critic of the Clinton administration's foreign policy initiatives, died on Saturday in Wappingers Falls, N. Y. He was 94. His death, at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, was confirmed by his wife, Georgia Gilman, who said he had been hospitalized for more than three years after hip surgery. First elected to the House of Representatives in 1972, Mr. Gilman was a moderate Republican who focused on foreign affairs throughout most of his years in Washington. From 1995 to 2000, he was chairman of the International Relations Committee, as the House Foreign Affairs Committee was then known. He was named to lead the panel after the Republicans won control of the House in 1994. Mr. Gilman accused President Bill Clinton of favoring Russia over other former Soviet republics, and said the president was indecisive on issues involving Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. “Instead of a strong, steady signal on foreign policy coming from the nation's capital, regrettably the world has heard a series of wavering notes sounded by an uncertain trumpet, leaving our allies concerned and our adversaries confused,” he said in one assessment. Believing that Mr. Clinton was not shaping a sufficiently tough policy on North Korea's development of nuclear weapons, Mr. Gilman introduced legislation to prevent the president from lifting economic sanctions against that country until it made major concessions on freezing its nuclear weapons program and halting missile tests. He also contended that the Clinton administration had a “lethargic approach” toward helping Iraqis who wanted to overthrow President Saddam Hussein. A staunch supporter of Israel, Mr. Gilman accused the administration of bullying Israel into accepting unfavorable terms in talks with the Palestinians. A week after making that accusation, in May 1998, Mr. Gilman spoke to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at a luncheon at the Capitol. “We want you to know that you're not only among friends, but among mishpocheh,” said Mr. Gilman, who was Jewish, using the Yiddish word for family. Although reflecting conservative Republican positions on many foreign policy issues, Mr. Gilman eschewed the firebrand tones of some of his party colleagues. He also departed from most congressional conservatives on issues like abortion rights and the environment, and was seen by many as a moderate in the tradition of Nelson A. Rockefeller. The Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion endorsed both him and his unsuccessful 1996 Democratic challenger, Yash P. Aggarwal, citing their equally strong abortion rights positions. The League of Conservation Voters listed Mr. Gilman among House members who supported measures to protect the environment. Mr. Gilman also focused on legislation to combat illegal drugs. In 1986, he and a colleague introduced a measure to provide $230 million for state and local police departments to set up   divisions. Mr. Gilman expressed anger when the Reagan administration released budget plans that sharply cut funding for such efforts. Earlier in his congressional career, Mr. Gilman helped to negotiate the releases of several Americans imprisoned abroad. As a result of one such negotiation, an American who had tried to smuggle some East Germans out of their country was released in 1978 by East Germany, and an Israeli was freed by Mozambique, which was then a Soviet ally, in exchange for the release of a convicted Soviet spy imprisoned in the United States. Mr. Gilman and the Israelis involved in the trade used code names while communicating by cable Mr. Gilman was called “Uncle Ben. ” In 1980, Mr. Gilman led an informal House committee that successfully negotiated with a Cuban diplomat for the release of 30 Americans imprisoned in Cuba. He left Congress in 2002 after the redistricting that followed the 2000 census consolidated his district and that of a fellow Republican, Sue W. Kelly. Mr. Gilman was seen as the underdog in a primary race between them, and he decided not to run again. He had won all of his previous elections. His district in the 1970s included Rockland and Orange Counties and some of Ulster County, and his later districts comprised Rockland and parts of Orange, Sullivan and Westchester Counties. Benjamin Arthur Gilman was born in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. on Dec. 6, 1922. He served in the Army Air Corps in World War II, flying 35 missions over Japan and earning a Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war, he graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and from New York Law School. He was an assistant New York State attorney general in the 1950s, then a lawyer in private practice. He was a New York assemblyman from 1966 to 1972. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Jonathan and Harrison a daughter, Susan a stepdaughter, Nicole Pappas a stepson, Peter Tingus and 11 grandchildren. A son, David, and a daughter, Ellen, died before him. Two previous marriages ended in divorce. After leaving Congress, Mr. Gilman founded the Gilman Group, a lobbying and consulting business in Washington specializing in international matters. In 2003 and 2004, he was the United States representative to the 58th session of the United Nations General Assembly.",

         "Extremists Turn to a Leader to Protect Western Values: Vladimir Putin - The New York Times",
         "Alan Feuer and Andrew Higgins",
         "As the founder of the Traditionalist Worker Party, an American group that aims to preserve the privileged place of whiteness in Western civilization and fight “  degeneracy,” Matthew Heimbach knows whom he envisions as the ideal ruler: the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. “Russia is our biggest inspiration,” Mr. Heimbach said. “I see President Putin as the leader of the free world. ” Throughout the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump mystified many on the left and in the foreign policy establishment with his praise for Mr. Putin and his criticism of the Obama administration's efforts to isolate and punish Russia for its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. But what seemed inexplicable when Mr. Trump first expressed his admiration for the Russian leader seems, in retrospect, to have been a shrewd dog whistle to a small but highly motivated part of his base. For Mr. Heimbach is far from alone in his esteem for Mr. Putin. Throughout the collection of white ethnocentrists, nationalists, populists and   that has taken root on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. Putin is widely revered as a kind of white knight: a symbol of strength, racial purity and traditional Christian values in a world under threat from Islam, immigrants and rootless cosmopolitan elites. “I've always seen Russia as the guardian at the gate, as the easternmost outpost of our people,” said Sam Dickson, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan lawyer who frequently speaks at gatherings of the     a   fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and   positions. “They are our barrier to the Oriental invasion of our homeland and the great protector of Christendom. I admire the Russian people. They are the strongest white people on earth. ” Fascination with and, in many cases, adoration of Mr. Putin  —   or at least a distorted image of him  —   first took hold among   politicians in Europe, many of whom have since developed close relations with their brethren in the United States. Such ties across the Atlantic have helped spread the view of Mr. Putin's Russia as an ideal model. “We need a chancellor like Putin, someone who is working for Germany and Europe like Putin works for Russia,” said Udo Voigt, leader of Germany's National Democratic Party. That   group views Chancellor Angela Merkel as a traitor because she opened the door to nearly a million migrants from Syria and elsewhere last year. “Putin is a symbol for us of what is possible,” Mr. Voigt said. The Obama administration has accused Russian interests of meddling in the presidential campaign by spreading fake news and  hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the emails of John Podesta, a leading figure in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. But efforts by Russia, which has jailed some of its own white supremacist agitators, to organize and inspire extreme   groups in the United States and Europe may ultimately prove more influential. His voice amplified by   think tanks, the Orthodox Church and   news media, like RT and Sputnik, that are aimed at foreign audiences, Mr. Putin has in recent years reached out to conservative and nationalist groups abroad with the message that he stands with them against gay rights activists and other forces of moral decay. He first embraced this theme when, campaigning for his third term as president in early 2012, he presented Russia not only as a military power deserving of international respect, but also as a “civilizational model” that could rally all those in Russia and beyond who were fed up with the erosion of traditional values. The Kremlin has also provided financial and logistical support to   forces in the West, said Peter Kreko, an analyst at Political Capital, a research group in Budapest. Though Jobbik, a   party in Hungary and other groups have been accused of receiving money from Moscow, the only proven case so far involves the National Front in France, which got loans worth more than $11 million from Russian banks. Russia also shares with   groups across the world a deeply held belief that, regardless of their party, traditional elites should be deposed because of their support for globalism and transnational institutions like NATO and the European Union. But this means different things to different groups and people. Mr. Putin, for example, has “a natural interest in making a mess in Europe and the U. S.,” Mr. Kreko said. But for Mr. Heimbach, whose Traditionalist Worker Party uses the slogan “Globalism is the poison, nationalism is the antidote,” the term “international elites” is often an   code for Jews, though he denied any racist intent. Mr. Putin has never personally promoted white supremacist ideas, and has repeatedly insisted that Russia, while predominantly white and Christian, is a vast territory of diverse religions and ethnic groups stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Nor has he displayed any sign of hostility toward Jews, a fact that has infuriated some of Russia's more extremist nationalist groups. In fact, Mr. Putin's agenda is not purely ideological. It is as much about accomplishing strategic goals like destabilizing Europe and NATO, or forcing the European Union to rescind the sanctions it applied after his forays into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. This has not stopped people like Richard B. Spencer, who runs the website AlternativeRight. com and directs the National Policy Institute, an   group based in Montana, from hailing Mr. Putin as a protector of the white race. Not all of the   has fully embraced the Russian leader. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's new chief strategist, who until he entered the White House ran Breitbart News, which he has called a platform for the   has a complicated view of Mr. Putin. In a speech in 2014, he said that Mr. Putin ran a “kleptocracy,” but also that “we, the   West, really have to look at what he's talking about as far as traditionalism goes. ” Mr. Spencer, who held a   conference in Washington in November, produced a video last year in which he claimed that “an understanding” between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin might bring together Slavic and American Caucasians and eventually “foretell a unified white world. ” This summer, he echoed those remarks when he told The Nation magazine, “I think we should be   because Russia is the great white power that exists in the world. ” In an interview this past week, Mr. Spencer  —   he made headlines at his conference by shouting “Hail Trump!”  —   offered a more measured version of this sentiment, referring to Mr. Putin as “a normal leader in an abnormal world. ” “He wants to conserve his nation and his people,” Mr. Spencer said. “He recognizes certain enemies and certain traditions that should remain, like the church and the state. These are very normal conservative ends. ” Mr. Spencer acknowledged that Mr. Putin did not share his ideology, but played that down, saying, “We can look to Putin as someone we can admire and understand. ” Mr. Putin's fans in Europe generally avoid white supremacist ideas, at least in public, but have also praised him for his nationalistic pride and his views on Islamic extremism, immigration and traditional sexual mores. When ordinary people see that “a man can kiss a man in the street in Germany, they look to the east and Russia and see that this kind of a new life has been stopped there,” said Mr. Voigt, the German   leader. “For us, this is hope. ” Mr. Voigt added that he and his party “agree 100 percent with Putin's position” on homosexuality: “We are absolutely against gender politics for my country and for Europe. ” Not all of Europe's   populists are smitten with Mr. Putin, though most tend to see him much more favorably than their own entrenched elites. “I'm more a fan than not,” said Tom Van Grieken, the leader of Vlaams Belang, a Belgian group that champions independence for the   region of Flanders. “He does a good job for Russian interests. But I'm not sure he is good for the rest of the world. ” In Mr. Putin's favor, Mr. Van Grieken insisted that Russia had been demonized by a Belgian establishment that “is a slave to America,” adding, “Putin is not black or white, but 50 shades of gray. ” Last year, in an effort to unite disparate and occasionally feuding   groups and to place Russia squarely at the center of the expanding movement against liberal elites, a Russian political party, Rodina, organized a gathering of nationalist figures from Europe, the United States and elsewhere in a cramped conference room at St. Petersburg's Holiday Inn. Fyodor V. Biryukov, a leader of the Rodina, or Motherland, party, said it was the first time that activists in the vanguard of “a new global revolution” had gotten together to rail against   marriage, political correctness, radical Islamists and New York financiers. He said the Kremlin had not supported the event, “but “did not bother us, either. ” Among the Europeans at the conference were representatives from Britain First, a   nationalist party, and Golden Dawn, the Greek   group. At least two Americans were also there. One of them was Mr. Dickson, the former Klan lawyer, who flew in from Atlanta and gave a speech that ended with a cry in halting Russian: “God save the czar!” The other was Jared Taylor, the founder of the white supremacist think tank American Renaissance, who said that the descendants of white Europeans risked being swept away by a wave of Africans, Central Americans and Asians. In recent years, Mr. Taylor has struck up ties with European groups, inviting officials from the National Front, Vlaams Belang and the British National Party to speak at his American Renaissance events. “There is a worldwide awakening of nationalism among European countries  —   and I include the United States in that,” Mr. Taylor said. “All across Europe, we are seeing the rise of parties expressing the idea that Europe, in order to remain Europe, must remain European. I have a feeling of intense kinship for those that wish to preserve their nation and their culture. ” Mr. Heimbach has made three trips to Europe in the last three years, meeting with officials from the Golden Dawn in Greece, the New Right in Romania and Mr. Voigt's National Democratic Party in Germany to discuss   and organizing strategies. In Prague in September, he addressed members of the Workers' Party of Social Justice, which opposes NATO and the European Union, has sought to criminalize homosexuality and has called for the Czech Republic to restore relations with Russia. “We white Americans can never be truly separated from our European brothers and sisters,” Mr. Heimbach told the crowd, “because we are all bonded together by shared blood, heritage and destiny. ” Tomas Vanas, the Czech party's chairman, said in a telephone interview this past week that he stood together with Mr. Putin and others to resist “the perverse liberal values of the Western world. ” From home in Ohio last month, Mr. Heimbach described his visits to Europe as field trips that help him learn how to make the white nationalist movement in the United States a “real political force. ” He also spoke about creating a broader, worldwide network, which he called, with a nod to Comintern, the old Communist International, “the Traditionalist International. ” In this, as in many things, Mr. Putin's Russia, now the home of a new global alliance of   groups called the World   Movement, was the template. “Russia has already taken its place on the global stage by organizing national movements as counterparts to Atlanticist elites,” Mr. Heimbach said. “Intellectually, they've shown us how it works. ”",

         "Katherine Rodriguez",
         "A Maryland school official was fired from her job after she corrected a student's spelling over Twitter. [Frederick County Public Schools has fired employee Katie Nash after she stirred up attention on how she ran the district's Twitter feed last week, the Frederick News Post reported.  On Jan. 5, a student tweeted to the FCPS Twitter account @FCPSMaryland and said, “close school tammarow PLEASE. ” Several hours later, Frederick County Public Schools Social Media Manager Katie Nash replied, “but then how would you learn how to spell ‘tomorrow?' :)” The response drew lots of attention and backlash over social media as thousands of people liked and retweeted the post. She eventually became the subject of a hashtag, #KatiefromFCPS, and later #freekatie when WHAG reported that her Twitter was taken away from her. Nash said she understands why she was fired and said she doesn't want to be a “distraction” to the school system, but thought her employer would have provided some suggestions on how to improve her job. “As a new employee, I think I sort of would have expected that there would have been some counseling or some suggestions on how to improve,” she said. Nash had decided to take a more playful tone on the school's Twitter account, citing student feedback. “We had received feedback from some students in a focus group that our tweeting was a bit flat, they were looking for some more engagement,” Nash said. “They were looking for us to tweet back at them and I really took that to heart because I know that I am a little bit older and maybe not as hip as some of the students are, so I took that to heart and I took that feedback in. ” The student later said that he didn't take the tweet personally, WGHP reported. Michael Doerrer, the Director of Communications, Community Engagement and Marketing with FCPS, said the school gave a personal apology to the student, WHAG reported.",

         "Vanity Fair: National Politics Are all About Donald Trump's Wall - Breitbart",
         "Neil Munro",
         "The fate of Donald Trump's presidency depends on whether Sen. Chuck Schumer can block construction of the border wall, says Vanity Fair. [The magazine's writer, T. A. Frank, is a liberal with some understanding of the Trump coalition and he argues that the Democrats hope to break Trump's presidency by blocking funds for the wall:  Thwart Trump and he looks weak. You force him to break his signature promise. His agenda stalls. The Hispanic vote moves even more solidly to the left. The Democratic base gets energized, and Trump's base gets demoralized and stays home in the next couple of elections. It's  . That's why Chuck Schumer has spoken of “shutting down the government” if Trump tries to get the wall going   …     People are now suggesting Trump has given up on the wall in all but rhetoric. And this would be momentous. If Trump's wall is dead, then Trump's presidency is dead, But Trump is still trying to get funds for the wall, in the face of uniform and public Democratic opposition plus widespread   opposition from GOP leaders. In a Friday, April 28 speech to the National Rifle Association, for example, he declared that: “We'll build a wall. Don't even think about [not getting a wall]. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it. That's an easy one. ” Amid unified Democratic opposition, Trump only has two choices, argues Vanity Fair: Trump's options are limited. He could in theory play —  or have played —  a ruthless game to get his way, since Trump has the power to revoke the “deferred action for childhood arrivals” or DACA order that Barack Obama signed in order to shield those who have arrived here illegally as children. An icier type wouldn't have hesitated to hold the fate of these people hostage for wall funding, employing rhetoric about the importance of tying today's forgiveness to tomorrow's prevention, and so on. But Trump shows few signs of being that callous, and he has conveyed only reassurances to the Dreamers. So threats of this sort will not be his approach. The second option would be to try to sell the wall —  and do a better job of it than he did with Ryancare   …     Trump could try to sell people on a vision of America with tighter labor markets [that push up higher wages] more equitable distribution of wealth, and less [civic] balkanization   …     He could pair this with a pitch for the wall, arguing that walls are peaceful and usually effective, and they reduce the need for more intrusive forms of enforcement such as workplace raids and deportation. But Trump has only figured out how to use the wall to sell himself. He never figured out how to use himself to sell the wall. Democrats oppose the wall, in large part, because it is an effective barrier that future politicians can't remove, and is also a concrete symbol of Americans' determination to block the flow of cheap labor,   customers, renters and future voters from Mexico to   cities along the coasts. But Trump also faces a huge problem in getting top GOP leaders to fund his plans for a wall, because the wall would shrink the flow of illegal immigrants sought by many business groups in Texas, Georgia and other red states. Throughout April, that   GOP opposition meant that GOP leaders failed to push Democrats to approve Trump's request to build an additional 48 miles of border barrier in 2017. The requested $1 billion was blocked by Democrats, although congressional leaders say Trump will get the extra funds for other homeland security tasks in the 2017 supplemental budget, now slated for approval in early May. The   GOP opposition is cloaking itself as a supporter of alternatives to Trump's permanent    barrier, such as an invisible fence of expensive sensors and border patrol agents which later can be switched off as soon as Trump leaves the White House. A wall “really means ‘security'   …     It could be open surveillance to prevent people from crossing,” Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told Bloomberg in December. “It does not mean an actual wall. ” “I've always thought the wall was a metaphor for securing the border,” not an actual wall, claimed Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson during an April CNN interview. “There will never be a   wall built, period,” claimed South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a   Republican. “I think it's become symbolic of better border security. It's a code word for better border security. If you make it about actually building a   wall, that's a bridge too far. ” “I think a wall is anything that will stop people from coming into the country illegally,” claimed Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Lou Barletta. “It could be a variety of what can be used to be successful. ” House Speaker Paul Ryan is also downplaying the wall part of the wall. “Conditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area,” he told CBS's “60 Minutes. ” Immigration reformers are pushing Trump to fight for wall funding in the 2018 budget, due in October. “Construction of a border wall was one of the president's signature promises during his campaign,” said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. As he has made clear, an effective border security plan would include a wall in areas of the border where it is a viable and effective deterrent and that other sections of the border would be enhanced by technology and additional manpower. We expect that the president will deliver on these commitments. Unfortunately, past versions of a ‘comprehensive border security plan' have been ineffective because they did not require the laying of a single brick of border wall. Such a cosmetic approach was a precursor to amnesty and both have been consistently rejected by the American people. We look forward to seeing details of the president's plan that will actually get the job done of securing our southern border. ” However, border security is only one component of a needed overhaul of immigration. Much more is expected by the American people and the White House must demand Congress pass meaningful reforms to eliminate the incentives for illegal immigration and create a legal immigration system that truly serves identifiable national interests. ” Read more about the wall here.",

         "Microsoft Finds Cancer Clues in Search Queries - The New York Times",
         "John Markoff",
         "Microsoft scientists have demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries they may in some cases be able to identify internet users who are suffering from pancreatic cancer, even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease. The scientists said they hoped their work could lead to early detection of cancer. Their study was published on Tuesday in The Journal of Oncology Practice by Dr. Eric Horvitz and Dr. Ryen White, the Microsoft researchers, and John Paparrizos, a Columbia University graduate student. “We asked ourselves, ‘If we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that something's going on? '” Dr. Horvitz said. The researchers focused on searches conducted on Bing, Microsoft's search engine, that indicated someone had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. From there, they worked backward, looking for earlier queries that could have shown that the Bing user was experiencing symptoms before the diagnosis. Those early searches, they believe, can be warning flags. While   survival rates for pancreatic cancer are extremely low, early detection of the disease can prolong life in a very small percentage of cases. The study suggests that early screening can increase the   survival rate of pancreatic patients to 5 to 7 percent, from just 3 percent. The researchers reported that they could identify from 5 to 15 percent of pancreatic cases with false positive rates of as low as one in 100, 000. The researchers noted that false positives could lead to raised medical costs or create significant anxiety for people who later found out they were not sick. The data used by the researchers was anonymized, meaning it did not carry identifying markers like a user name, so the individuals conducting the searches could not be contacted. A logical next step would be to figure out what to do with that search information. One possibility would be some sort of health service where users could allow their searches to be collected, allowing scientists to monitor for questions that indicate warning flag symptoms. “The question, ‘What might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day? '” said Dr. Horvitz, in a reference to the company's   online personal assistant software service. Although the researchers declined to offer specific details, Dr. White is now the chief technology officer of health intelligence in a recently created Health  Wellness division at Microsoft. They acknowledged that   data generated from web search histories was still new territory for the medical profession. “I think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data,” Dr. Horvitz said. “We're hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation. ” The new research is based on the ability of the Microsoft team to accurately distinguish between web searches that are casual or based on anxiety and those that are genuine searches for specific medical symptoms by people who are experiencing them, he noted. Both a computer scientist and a medical doctor by training, Dr. Horvitz said he had been exploring this area in part because of a phone conversation with a close friend who had described symptoms. Based on their conversation, Dr. Horvitz advised him to contact his doctor. He received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and died several months later. The availability of vast sets of behavior data based on individual web queries using the search engines offered by companies like Google and Microsoft has for a number of years been seen as a potential indicator of   information. In 2009, Google published a research paper that explored the potential of early detection of flu epidemics based on statistical analysis of web search logs, though the results of that effort ultimately fell short of what had been hoped. More recently, Microsoft researchers have had significant success in finding early evidence of adverse drug reactions from patterns observed in web logs. In 2013, they detected unreported side effects of prescription drugs before they were found by the Food and Drug Administration's warning system. The researchers are exploring evidence related to a range of devastating diseases. They also said that unlike the drug interaction data, which would be of direct value to the F. D. A. as an early alert, it was possible that symptom alert data might be made available as part of a broader online health service that a company like Microsoft might offer.",

         "The FBI Can't Actually Investigate a Candidate Such as Hillary Clinton.",
         "Eric Zuesse.",
         "Posted on November 4, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org The power above the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the U.S. Attorney General, and, above that person, the U.S. President. That's whom the FBI actually serves — not the U.S. public. This is the reason why the FBI is having such internal tensions and dissensions over the investigation of Hillary Clinton: Not only is she the current President's ardently preferred and designated successor — and overwhelmingly supported also by America's artistocracy and endorsed by the aristocracy's press — but the top leadership of the FBI have terms-in-office that (unlike, for example, the term of the U.S. Attorney General) do not end with the installation of the next President; and these people will therefore be serving, quite possibly, the very same person whom they are now ‘investigating'. This is the reason why James Comey, the FBI's Director, let Clinton totally off the hook on July 5th, when he declined to present the case to a grand jury: he and the rest of the FBI's top management violated three basic principles of trying white-collar-crime cases when a prosecutor is serious about wanting to prosecute and obtain a conviction against a person — he (and they) wanted to keep their jobs, not be fighting their boss and their likely future boss. If America were an authentic democracy, there would be a way for the FBI to serve the public even when the U.S. President doesn't want it to. According to the only scientific study that has ever been done of the matter, the U.S. federal government is a dictatorship not a democracy. This was reluctantly reported by the researchers, whose own careers are dependent upon the aristocracy which they were finding actually controls that government. They found that the U.S., at the federal level, is not a democracy but an “oligarchy,” by which the researchers were referring to an “economic elite,” America's billionaires and centi-millionaires who control America's international corporations and the ‘charities' (such as think tanks) that are dependent upon them — including many that directly affect U.S. politics, such as the think tanks or other way-stations for former U.S. government employees to become hired by private firms. The authors of the only empirical scientific research-study that has been done of whether the United States is a democracy , or instead a dictatorship, excluded the very term “aristocracy” (or “collective dictatorship” such as an “economic elite” is if that “elite” actually is in control of the given nation's government) from their article. They did this so as for the meaning not to be clear to the U.S. public. In any country in the modern world where an aristocracy exists, aristocrats nowadays try to hide their power, not (like in former eras) display their power by crowns and other public symbols of ‘the nobility'. The closest the study's authors came to using that term, “aristocracy,” was their only sentence that employed the pejoritave term for an aristocracy, “oligarchy.” That obscure lone sentence was: “Jeffrey Winters has posited a comparative theory of ‘Oligarchy,' in which the wealthiest citizens — even in a ‘civil oligarchy' like the United States — dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth and income protection.11″ Their 11th footnote made clear that they were referring here to the book Oligarchy , by Jeffrey A. Winters, which stated the ‘theory' that this article had actually just confirmed in the American case. Their article mentioned the book — and the “oligarchy” — only in this one footnote, so that the authors of the article (whose own careers are dependent upon America's ‘oligarchs') won't be able to be accused by oligarchs (or in any way thought by their own financial benefactors — America's aristocrats) to have called the U.S. an “oligarchy” (a collective dictatorship by the few super-rich and their agents). To apply either term — “aristocracy” or “oligarchy” — to one's own country, is now viewed as negative, an insult to the country's controlling elite. Neither scholars nor scholarly publishers wish to insult the people who ultimately are their top funders. This article was written in the standard unnecessarily obscurantist style of social ‘scientists' who want to be comprehensible only to their peers and not to the general public. Doing it this way is safer for them, because it makes extremely unlikely that their own benefactors would retaliate, against them or else against the institutions that hire them, by withdrawing their continued financial and promotional support (such as by no longer having them invited onto CNN as an “expert”). (This type of fear prevents theory in the social ‘sciences' from being strictly based upon the given field's empirical findings: it's not authentically scientific. The physical sciences are far less corrupt, far more scientific. The biological sciences are in-between.) One particular reason why the authors never called the people who control the U.S. government an “aristocracy,” is that everyone knows that the Founders of the U.S. were opposed to , and were engaged in overthrowing, the existing aristocracy, which happened to be British, and that they even banned forever in the U.S. the use of aristocratic titles, such as “Lord” or “Sir.” Consequently, within the U.S., the only term that the aristocrats consider acceptable to refer to aristocrats, is “oligarchs,” which always refers only to aristocrats in foreign countries , and so is considered safe by the aristocrats' writers (including scholars and political pundits) to use. Everyone knows: in accord with the clear intention of America's Founders , the U.S. should eliminate from its citizenry any aristocrat (any self-enclosed and legally immune group that holds power over the government), but Americans naturally accept the existence of “oligarchs” in other countries (and “good-riddance to them there”), typically the ones in countries U.S. foreign policy opposes and often overthrows by means of coup or outright military invasion (any form of conquest, such as in 2003 Iraq, or 2011 Libya). It's fine to refer to other countries' aristocracies as ‘oligarchies', because any such foreign aristocracy can therefore be declared to be bad and ‘deserving' of overthrow. Thus, any aristocracy that is opposed to America's aristocracy (especially one that's opposed to being controlled by the U.S. aristocracy), and which wants to be controlling instead their own independent nation, can acceptably be overthrown by coup (such as Ukraine 2014 was) or invasion (such as Libya 2011 was). Thus, calling a foreign aristocracy an “oligarchy” is supportive of, not oppposed to, the U.S. aristocracy — and, so, “oligarchy” is the term the authors used (on that one occasion, and they never used the prohibited term “aristocracy”). Nonetheless, despite the cultural ban on describing the U.S. as an “aristocracy,” the authors were — as obscurely as they were able — proving that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no authentic democracy at all. Or, again, as they said it in their least-obscurantist phrasing of it: “Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans — though useful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases — is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater.” ‘Greater' than what? They didn't say. That's because what they were saying (as obscurely as possible) is that it's probably ‘greater' than is shown in the data that was publicly available to them, and upon which data their clear finding is that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no democracy at all. Or, as they also put it: “Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis.” But, actually, “Economic Elite Domination theories” (virtually all of which come down to positing an aristocracy that consists of the billionaires — and centi-millionaires — and their corporations, and their think tanks, and their lobbyists, etc.) did phenomenally well, in their findings, not just ‘rather well' — they simply can't safely say this. Saying it is samizdat, in the U.S. dictatorship. They were allowed to prove it, but not to say it. So, that's what they did. They didn't want to “upset the applecart” from which they themselves are feeding. The simplest (but no less accurate) way of stating their finding is: the U.S., at least during the period the researchers probed, which was 1981-2002, was an aristocracy, no democracy at all. The U.S., in other words, was (even prior to the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which is making the aristocracy even more concentrated among even fewer people) a country of men (and women — that's to say, of individuals ) not of laws; it's a dictatorship, in short; it is not a country “of laws, not of men” . America's Founders have finally lost. The country has been taken over by an aristocracy. And one of those “men” now, is actually Hillary Clinton, even though she is no longer officially holding governmental power. They know she soon might be. That's why, the FBI cannot really, and seriously , investigate her. It's not for legal reasons at all. It's because of whom she is. In fact, purely on the basis of U.S. laws, she clearly ought to be in prison . Any honest lawyer, inside or outside the FBI, has long known this, because the actual case against her is ‘slam-dunk' , even though the FBI has refused to investigate it and has limited its ‘investigation' only to peripheral ‘national security' issues. (The #2 person at FBI, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, right below Director James Comey, specified this limitation to his ‘investigators'. They simply weren't allowed to investigate her, except on the hardest-to-prove crimes that she probably but not definitely did also do. The slam-dunks were just off-limits to them. McCabe's wife's political campaign had received $675,000 from the PAC of Terry McAuliffe , a close friend of the Clintons, who chaired Hillary's 2008 Presidential campaign. And, even on the harder-to-prove matters, which FBI Director Comey declined on July 5th to pursue, they stood a strong chance of winning, if only Comey hadn't prevented their moving forward to try — but those issues are tangential to the basic case against her, anyway.) There are at least six federal criminal laws which accurately and unquestionably describe even what Ms. Clinton has now publicly admitted having done by her privatized email system, and intent isn't even mentioned in most of them nor necessary in order for her to be convicted — the actions themselves convict her, and the only relevance that intent might have, regarding any of these laws, would be in determining how long her prison sentence would be. I have already presented the texts of these six laws (and you can see the sentences for each one, right there), and any reader can easily recognize that each one of them describes, unambiguously without any doubt, what she now admits having done. Most of these crimes don't require any intent in order to convict (and the ones that do require intent are only “knowingly … conceals,” or else “with the intent to impair the object's … use in an official proceeding,” both of which “intents” would be easy to prove on the basis of what has already been made public — but others of these laws don't require even that); and none of them requires any classified information to have been involved, at all . It's just not an issue in these laws. Thus, conviction under them is far easier. If a prosecutor is really seeking to convict someone, he'll be aiming to get indictments on the easiest-to-prove charges, first. That also presents for the prosecutor the strongest position in the event of an eventual plea-bargain. As Alan Dershowitz said , commenting on one famous prosecution: “They also wanted a slam-dunk case. They wanted the strongest possible case.” Comey simply didn't; he wanted the hardest -to-convict case. His presentation was a brazen hoax. That's all. That's the real scandal, and nobody (other than I) has been writing about it as what it is — a hoax. But what it shows is that maybe the only way that Clinton will be able to avoid going to prison is by her going to the White House. Either she gets a term in the White House, or else she gets a (much longer) term in prison — or else our government is so thoroughly corrupt that she remains free as a private citizen and still above the law, even though not serving as a federal official. Even if she is convicted only on these six slam-dunk statutes (and on none other, including not on the ones that Comey was referring to when he said on July 5th that, “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case”), she could be sentenced to a maximum of 73 years in prison (73 = 5 + 5 + 20 + 20 + 3 + 10 + 10). Adding on others she might also have committed (such as the ones that Comey was referring to, all of which pertain only to the handling of classified information), would mean that her term in prison might be lengthier still, but what's important in the email case isn't that; it's to convict her on, essentially, theft and/or destruction of U.S. government documents by means of transferring them into her private email and/or smashing hard drives. No one, not even a U.S. federal official, can legally do that, and those six laws are specifically against it. Motive is important in Ms. Clinton's email case, because motive tells us why she was trying to hide from historians and from the public her operations as the U.S. Secretary of State: was it because she didn't want them to know that she was selling to the Sauds and her other friends the U.S. State Department's policies in return for their million-dollar-plus donations to the Clinton Foundation , and maybe even selling to them (and/or their cronies) U.S. government contracts, or why? However, those are questions regarding other crimes that she might have been perpetrating while in public office, not the crimes of her privatized email operation itself; and those other crimes (whatever they might have been) would have been explored only after an indictment on the slam-dunks, and for further possible prosecutions, if President Obama's people were serious about investigating her. They weren't. Clearly, this is selective ‘justice'. That's the type of ‘justice' an aristocracy imposes. Why, then, did Comey finally switch to re-open the Clinton case? It wasn't merely the discovery of some of her previously unknown emails on the computer of Anthony Wiener, husband to Hillary's closest aide Huma Abedin. As Politico on October 28th reported , “Another former Justice official said Comey's letter [announcing the re-opening of Hillary's case] could be part of an effort on his part to quiet internal FBI critics who viewed him as burying the Clinton probe for political reasons. ‘He's come under a lot of criticism from his own people for how he's handled this. He's trying to gain back some of their respect,' former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ‘His ability to do what he does largely depends on the respect within his own ranks.'” Joachim Hagopian at Global Research headlined on October 30th, “The Real Reasons Why FBI Director James Comey Reopened the Hillary Email Investigation” , and reported: “Former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. … Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday's interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash.” In other words: Comey was between a rock (the resignation-letters piling up on his desk from subordinates who felt that no person should be above the law) and a hard place (his ability to stay on at the FBI and not have a scandal against himself bleed out to the public from down below). The U.S. wasn't yet that kind of dictatorship — one which could withstand such a public disclosure. In order for it to become one, the aristocracy's control would have needed to be even stronger than it yet is. Also on the 30th, Ed Klein in Britain's Dail Mail bannered : EXCLUSIVE: Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was wrong: Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation James Comey revived the investigation of Clinton's email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents, sources say The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim [Comey] announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents So, does this now mean that, finally, the FBI will bring before a grand jury the evidence that Hillary Clinton blatantly violated those six federal criminal laws against stealing and/or trying to destroy federal documents? There has never — at least since 1981 — been so severe a test of the extent to which this nation is (as those researchers found it to have unquestionably been between 1981 and 2002) an “oligarchy.” However, a serious criminal prosecution of Ms. Clinton would potentially start an unwinding of this dictatorship. The present writer will make no prediction. However, obviously, the results of the election on November 8th will certainly have an enormous impact upon the outcome. Since I think that anyone but a complete fool can recognize this much, I'm confident enough to assert it — a conditional about the future.",

         "Obama Operatives Direct Town Hall Disruptions Nationwide - Breitbart",
         "Penny Starr",
         "As members of Congress wind up their Easter break back in their districts, a website honoring former President Barack Obama is providing “progressives” with the information and tools they need to disrupt town hall meetings that lawmakers are holding over the remainder of this week. [Visitors to the townhallproject. com website can find everything from detailed information on each scheduled town hall meeting to how to make signs and even specific questions to ask to push the agenda on a range of talking points including: investigating President Donald Trump, Trump's “starvation budget” on foreign policy, climate change, supporting illegal aliens, and LGBT rights.  By clicking on the “about” icon, the first thing that pops up is a quote from Obama's farewell speech in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. “It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title:  Citizen,” Obama said. The website states: Town Hall Project empowers constituents across the country to have    conversations with their elected representatives. We are campaign veterans and first time volunteers. We come from a diversity of backgrounds and live across the country. We share progressive values and believe strongly in civic engagement. We research every district and state for public events with members of Congress. Then we share our findings to promote participation in the democratic process. The page also reveals the kind of progressives who are manning the town hall effort by naming its “sponsors,” including moveon. org and the Center for American Progress  —   the latter under direction from John Podesta, longtime Obama operative and Hillary Clinton campaign manager. The town hall website links to the websites of both organizations as well as the sponsoring “Indivisible” website, which features a video of Rachel Maddow on MSNBC reporting about the power of the town hall “movement. ” “If the Tea Party was able to take on a historically popular President Obama with a Democratic supermajority to slow and sometimes defeat his federal agenda, we can surely take on Donald Trump and the members of Congress who would do his bidding,” the Indivisible website states. All three of the sponsors of the Town Hall Project website offer instructions. On the Indivisible website, protesters are told: “Your job isn't to convince your MoC (member of Congress) of anything. It is to create the political conditions necessary to force them into a new position —  or to replace them. This is a marathon, not a sprint and every mark against them will matter —  especially footage of them flailing in a town hall with you and your group. ” The moveon. org instructs protesters on “ ” lawmakers  —   “  is fun and easy!”  —   the website states.  How to bird dog successfully, states, in part: ● Arrive in advance. ○ You want to get a seat close to or in front of the stage or platform to make sure that you have the ability to ask a question and that your MoC can hear you. ○ If your group is protesting and is not invited in, make sure you find all the entrances and know where the parking lot is, if applicable, to try to map out the route your MoC will take in and out of the facility, to increase the chances that they see you. ● Don't give yourself away. ○ Do not wear clothing or wave signs that will let people know that you are coming to   your MoC. You want to make sure that you have an opportunity to ask your questions. ● Know your MoC's positions, • Study your MoC's positions on your topic of issues. You want to make sure that they know that you know what you are talking about. Many times, in an attempt to dismiss and discredit, elected officials look for ways to make you seem less informed and thus not qualified to ask your question. However, it is your right as a constituent to ask your question, and being informed will make it harder for you to be dismissed. CAP's “Recess toolbox” is entitled “Resist” and provides questions protesters should ask at town hall meetings:       • Will you call on President Trump to release his tax returns? We must know whether he'll profit from the GOP's tax reform plan. The long list of town halls promoted on the website totals 87 meetings this week for both Republican and Democrat lawmakers across the country. The website also encourages visitors who can't go to a town hall in person to call their representative, and contact information for members of Congress is provided. “You have more power than you think,” the website states. “Town halls are one of the most effective ways to use it. ” ",

         "Supreme Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan - The New York Times",
         "Adam Liptak and Michael D. Shear",
         "WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it had deadlocked in a case challenging President Obama's immigration plan, effectively ending what Mr. Obama had hoped would become one of his central legacies. The program would have shielded as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allowed them to legally work in the United States. The   tie, which left in place an appeals court ruling blocking the plan, amplified the contentious   debate over the nation's immigration policy and presidential power. When the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January, it seemed poised to issue a major ruling on presidential power. That did not materialize, but the court's action, which established no precedent and included no reasoning, was nonetheless perhaps its most important statement this term. The decision was just nine words long: “The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court. ” But its consequences will be vast, said Walter Dellinger, who was acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration. “Seldom have the hopes of so many been crushed by so few words,” he said. Speaking at the White House, Mr. Obama described the ruling as a deep disappointment for immigrants who would not be able to emerge from the threat of deportation for at least the balance of his term. “Today's decision is frustrating to those who seek to grow our economy and bring a rationality to our immigration system,” he said before heading to the West Coast for a   trip. “It is heartbreaking for the millions of immigrants who have made their lives here. ” The decision was one of two determined by tie votes Thursday  —   the other concerned Indian tribal courts  —   and one of four so far this term. The court is scheduled to issue its final three decisions of the term, including one on a restrictive Texas abortion law, on Monday. Mr. Obama said the court's immigration ruling was a stark reminder of the consequences of Republicans' refusal to consider Judge Merrick B. Garland, the president's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. “If you keep on blocking judges from getting on the bench, then courts can't issue decisions,” Mr. Obama said. “And what that means is then you are going to have the status quo frozen, and we are not able to make progress on some very important issues. ” The case, United States v. Texas, No.   concerned a 2014 executive action by the president to allow as many as five million unauthorized immigrants who were the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program that would spare them from deportation and provide them with work permits. The program was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. Mr. Obama has said he took the action after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, promptly challenged the plan, accusing the president of ignoring administrative procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by circumventing Congress. “Today's decision keeps in place what we have maintained from the very start: One person, even a president, cannot unilaterally change the law,” Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said in a statement after the ruling. “This is a major setback to President Obama's attempts to expand executive power, and a victory for those who believe in the separation of powers and the rule of law. ” The court did not disclose how the justices had voted, but they were almost certainly split along ideological lines. Administration officials had hoped that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would join the court's   liberal wing to save the program. The case hinged in part on whether Texas had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. Texas said it had standing because it would be costly for the state to give driver's licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy. Chief Justice Roberts is often skeptical of expansive standing arguments. But it seemed plain when the case was argued in April that he was satisfied that Texas had standing, paving the way for a deadlock. Mr. Obama said the White House did not believe the terse ruling from the court had any effect on the president's authority to act unilaterally. But he said the practical effect would be to freeze his efforts on behalf of immigrants until after the November election. He also predicted that lawmakers would eventually act to overhaul the nation's immigration system. “Congress is not going to be able to ignore America forever,” he said. “It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. We get these spasms of politics around immigration and   and then our traditions and our history and our better impulses kick in. ” White House officials had repeatedly argued that presidents in both parties had used similar executive authority in applying the nation's immigration laws. And they said Congress had granted federal law enforcement wide discretion over how those laws should be carried out. But the court's ruling may mean that the next president will again need to seek a congressional compromise to overhaul the nation's immigration laws. And it left immigration activists deeply disappointed. “This is personal,” Rocio Saenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement. “We will remain at the front lines, committed to defending the immigration initiatives and paving the path to lasting immigration reform. ” The lower court rulings in the case were provisional, and the litigation will now continue and may again reach the Supreme Court when it is back at full strength. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that the program will be revived. In February 2015, Judge Andrew S. Hanen of Federal District Court in Brownsville, Tex. entered a preliminary injunction shutting down the program while the legal case proceeded. The government appealed, and a divided   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans affirmed the injunction. In their Supreme Court briefs, the states acknowledged that the president had wide authority over immigration matters, telling the justices that “the executive does have enforcement discretion to forbear from removing aliens on an individual basis. ” Their quarrel, they said, was with what they called a blanket grant of “lawful presence” to millions of immigrants, entitling them to various benefits. In response, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. told the justices that this “lawful presence” was merely what had always followed from the executive branch's decision not to deport someone for a given period of time. “Deferred action does not provide these individuals with any lawful status under the immigration laws,” he said. “But it provides some measure of dignity and decent treatment. ” “It recognizes the damage that would be wreaked by tearing apart families,” Mr. Verrilli added, “and it allows individuals to leave the shadow economy and work on the books to provide for their families, thereby reducing exploitation and distortion in our labor markets. ” The states said they had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave them standing to sue. Judge Jerry E. Smith, writing for the majority in the appeals court, focused on an injury said to have been suffered by Texas, which he said would have to spend millions of dollars to provide driver's licenses to immigrants as a consequence of the federal program. Mr. Verrilli told the justices that Texas' injury was   a product of its decision to offer driver's licenses for less than they cost to produce and to tie eligibility for them to federal standards. Texas responded that being required to change its laws was itself the sort of harm that conferred standing. “Such a forced change in Texas law would impair Texas' sovereign interest in ‘the power to create and enforce a legal code,'” the state's lawyers wrote in a brief. Judge Hanen grounded his injunction on the Obama administration's failure to give notice and seek public comments on its new program. He found that notice and comment were required because the program gave blanket relief to entire categories of people, notwithstanding the administration's assertion that it required    determinations about who was eligible for the program. The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one. The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama's statutory authority.",

         "How Omran Daqneesh, 5, Became a Symbol of Aleppo's Suffering - The New York Times",
         "Anne Barnard",
         "BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   In the images, he sits alone, a small boy coated with gray dust and encrusted blood. His little feet barely extend beyond his seat. He stares, bewildered, shocked and, above all, weary, as if channeling the mood of Syria. The boy, identified by medical workers as Omran Daqneesh, 5, was pulled from a damaged building after a Syrian government or Russian airstrike in the northern city of Aleppo. He was one of 12 children under the age of 15 treated on Wednesday  —   not a particularly unusual figure  —   at one of the hospitals in the city's   eastern section, according to doctors there. But some images strike a particular nerve, for reasons both obvious and unknowable, jarring even a public numbed to disaster. Omran's is one. Within minutes of being posted by witnesses and journalists, a photograph and a video of Omran began rocketing around the world on social media. Unwittingly, Omran  —   like Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who drowned last September and whose body washed up on a Turkish beach  —   is bringing new attention to the thousands upon thousands of children killed and injured during five years of war and the inability or unwillingness of global powers to stop the carnage. Maybe it was his haircut, long and floppy up top or his rumpled   showing the Nickelodeon cartoon character CatDog or his tentative, confused movements in the video. Or the instant and inescapable question of whether either of his parents was left alive. In any event, by Thursday morning, Omran's image had been broadcast and published around the world, and Syrians were sharing   of his photograph in memes that both cried for help and darkly mocked the futile repetitiveness of such pleas. One, riffing on Omran's officelike chair, showed him at a desk as if representing his country to the world. Another pasted him like a silent accusation between President Obama and his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir V. Putin. The drafting of Omran as an emblem of despair is not new images of dead and injured children from Syria are shared daily on social media, many of them indescribably more harrowing. Pieces of children's bodies being pulled from rubble are photographed with appalling regularity in a war of indiscriminate attacks, most often from government airstrikes and shelling but also from rebel mortars. But while the mind revolts against looking too long at those pictures, and many news media shun them as too gruesome, it may be the relatively familiar look of Omran's distress that allows a broader public to relate to it. In the case of Alan, the Syrian toddler who washed up on a beach after his family tried to reach Europe on a smuggler's boat, the child was dead. But his body was intact, lying in the sand as if sleeping, and dressed neatly with evident parental love for his big journey. Omran, as he is carried from a damaged building in the dark, could be Everychild. He looks around in confusion, his chubby forearm draped trustingly across the reflective stripe on his rescuer's back, before he is plopped into the chair at the back of an ambulance, lit blindingly white. He settles into a   stare, apparently too stunned to cry. Then he puts a hand to his bloody brow, looks at his palm in surprise, and tries to wipe it on the chair. He glances around, as if trying to understand where he is. Omran's picture and video were distributed by the Aleppo Media Center, a longstanding group of antigovernment activists and citizen journalists who document the conflict. They were also shared with journalists by doctors from the hospital where he was treated, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society. The video shows two more small children brought to the ambulance, and then two adults. They were taken to a hospital already swamped with casualties. Mohammad   a radiology nurse, was in the emergency room when Omran arrived around 9 p. m. with bruises and cuts all over his body. “The boy was traumatized,” Mr. Ahmad said. “He wasn't speaking when he arrived. A few minutes later, he started crying from pain. ” Mr. Ahmad cleaned Omran's face and bandaged his head, as images shared by the hospital's medical staff showed. Doctors said they found no apparent signs of brain injury. In the chaos, the hospital workers, who communicated via online messages, could not immediately say which of the boy's adult relatives were alive and whether they were with him. That is not unusual, medical workers say, in a city where some dead and injured children cannot even be identified because they are brought in alone. Bombings bring so many patients at once that doctors treat them on the floor, and hospitals and medical workers have been systematically targeted in the war. Later, doctors at the hospital said they had verified that Omran's parents had survived, though their home had been destroyed. Relatives declined to speak, saying they were afraid of government reprisals. The doctors said the family may have relatives living in   territory. Mahmoud Raslan, who had taken some of the video and photographs of Omran, said in an interview that the boy lived with his mother, father and three siblings, and that they were all injured. Cases like Omran's are a daily sight in eastern Aleppo, several doctors said, adding that he was lucky in that he made it to a hospital that was still open. Mr. Ahmad, the nurse, said three other children had been hospitalized with Omran, along with a    man who had been stuck under rubble for eight hours. He said that at least three people had died in the strike. “But Omran took all the attention,” he said. Mr. Raslan, the photographer, was surprised that the images of this one boy drew so much news coverage when, he said, he photographs similar events every day. On Thursday morning, journalists from around the world were clamoring in an online chat group for more information about Omran and his family. But the doctors had moved on. They were handling yet another influx from a bombing that morning, later posting new images. A boy lay on the floor, his legs missing. A woman in black put her hand to her mouth in anguish. Another boy lay on a gurney, soaked in blood, as a clinician worked on him. A few minutes later came another text message: The boy had died. His name was Ibrahim Hadiri, and there was a new photograph of his face, eyes closed. It is not likely to go viral.",

         "Joel B. Pollak",
         "  tweeted his support for L. L. Bean, the clothing and outdoor equipment company, in response to a leftist effort to boycott the company because one of its 50   donated money to a   political action committee (PAC). [The donor, Linda Bean, is one of the members of the family that founded the company. She donated $60, 000 to the Making America Great Again LLC PAC, which is reportedly being converted to a super PAC so that it can accept the donation legally. The maximum individual contribution to a regular PAC allowed in the 2016 election was $5, 000 per individual.  A   campaign called “#GrabYourWallet” subsequently added L. L. Bean to its list of companies to consider boycotting, solely because, according to its online boycott spreadsheet, “Company leader raised funds for Trump PAC. ” In response, and in apparent reaction to media coverage of the controversy over the past few days, Trump tweeted his support for Bean and the company: Thank you to Linda Bean of L. L. Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L. L. Bean. @LBPerfectMaine,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017,  Critics, such as Mara Liasson of National Public Radio, argued that Trump was not just defending a business from a boycott, but attempting to pick “winners and losers” in the economy for political reasons. Obama frequently plugged his favorite companies at several points in his presidency. In 2012, he called JP Morgan Chase “one of the best managed banks there is. ” At the time, Obama had more than $500, 000 in funds in an account at the bank. Joel B.

November 2016 français Español Der britische Verteidigungsminister Michael Fallon hat angekündigt, dass sein Land die Freie Syrische Armee (FSA) wieder ausbilden werde. Seine Regierung nimmt also das Trainingsprogramm der so genannten moderaten Kämpfer wieder auf, das von Präsident Obama im Jahr 2014 gestartet wurde.\nDie FSA wurde von Frankreich im Jahr 2011 rund um den libyschen Führer von al-Kaida, Abdelhakim Belhadsch, geschaffen. Die Operation wurde als Hilfe für syrische, von Oberst Riad el-Asaad kommandierte Deserteure, dargestellt. Allmählich sind die Mitglieder der FSA aber al-Kaida beigetreten. Im Jahr 2016 wurde das FSA- Etikett durch die Türkei, die es für ihre turkmenischen Milizen verwendet, wieder ins Leben gerufen.\nDie Vereinigten Staaten hatten ihrerseits in der Zwischenzeit eine halbe Milliarde Dollar für die Ausbildung von neuen „Rebellen-Kämpfern“ ausgegeben.

         "Colorado Towns Work to Preserve a Diminishing Resource: Darkness - The New York Times",
         "Jack Healy",
         "WESTCLIFFE, Colo.  —   As people around the world stepped into their backyards or onto rooftops to peer up at the annual spectacle of the Perseid meteor shower early on Friday morning, few of them had a view like Wilson Jarvis and Steve Linderer. At 2:30 a. m. as the light show was peaking, the two men sat on a grassy bluff here in the Wet Mountain Valley of southern Colorado, swaddled in blankets against the chilly mountain air and looking up at the stars in the torrent of the Milky Way. Every few seconds, a tiny chunk of space ice cast off by Comet   would blaze through Earth's atmosphere, silently streaking through the darkness. “There's one!” the men called out. “And another!” “I saw that. ” Night skies like this one are disappearing across much of the world, nibbled away by the   glow of city lights. American skies are no different. Four out of five Americans live in places where they can no longer see the Milky Way. But here, the tiny neighboring ranching and railroad towns of Westcliffe (population 568) and Silver Cliff (population 587) have decided to tap into the dwindling natural resource of darkness. The old silver mines that once made Silver Cliff Colorado's   town are long closed, and many ranchers are retiring. But there is still the night. So for more than a decade, the two towns and a local   nonprofit have been dialing down the dimmer switch. They have replaced streetlights and passed rules requiring that outdoor lights point down. The group built a small observatory with star guides who tee up its telescope and take people on a tour of the night. They coax homeowners to hood their porch lamps or dim a bright light outside their house. “People out of ignorance go with whatever's cheap or whatever's brightest,” said Ed Stewart, a board member of the local   group. “You multiply that by 200, 300, and there goes the sky. ” He said advocates met with homeowners' associations and held stargazing parties to sell the virtues of the night. When they gaze over the valley and see winking floodlights on a ranch or home in the hills, they see their next targets of persuasion. “You can't just go up to someone and say, you've got a bad light, and legislate the problem away,” he said. “People resist that, especially in Colorado. ” The mayor of Westcliffe, Christy Patterson, said she once got a phone call complaining that her garage light was too bright. “I didn't even have the light on,” she said. In 2012, Mr. Stewart said a new store opened in town that flouted the area's nighttime sensitivities and became a glowing eyesore. He said people in the community wrote letters to the editor, urging the store's manager to change the lighting until, finally, the store relented. “We feel like they're a part of the community now,” Mr. Stewart said. Last year, the International   Association, a nonprofit working to stop light pollution, rewarded their efforts by designating the two towns among a handful of   communities. Lovers of the night cheered  —   they had put their community on the map by blotting themselves out. A trickle of amateur stargazers have taken notice and have started to visit, telescopes in tow. When you drive into either town, the streets are not  . Streetlights and porch lights glow along the main street, where photos of   ranches are posted on the front windows of real estate offices. But viewed from the mountain pass above the towns, Westcliffe and Silver Cliff look less like an island of light than a constellation in the dark valley. “There aren't many towns, even small towns, where you can stand in town limits and see the Milky Way like that,” Mr. Linderer, 69, said from his camping chair.

         "Trump Plays Budget Hardball in Congress to Build Border Wall - Breitbart",
         "Neil Munro",
         "President Donald Trump's budget director is threatening to withhold funding for Obamacare subsidies unless Democrats agree to help fund the border wall in the 2017 budget supplemental. [The offer follows weeks of determined Democratic opposition  —   amid determined waffling by top GOP leaders  —   to any funding for Trump's wall during this year.  “We have our list of priorities,” budget director Mick Mulvaney said at a business conference on Thursday. He continued:  Won't surprise anyone what some of them are. We want more money for defense. We want to build a border wall. We want more money for immigration, law enforcement. The Democrats may have some of their own priorities. I [already] indicated making some of these payments for the Obamacare subsidies is one of their priorities. Okay, that's fine. We're willing to be at that discussion if they want to have it and that's what we're telegraphing   …     we understand they have a certain amount of leverage in the Senate because we do need 60 votes [to get funding]. So we need some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate. They are entitled under that set of circumstances to get some of their priorities funded. It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and Democrats some of their priorities. We think we've opened the door [to a compromise]. I know that we have. Democrats may be open to that compromise. On Wednesday, the Democrats' Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer told reporters that Democrats are trying to preserve funding for Obamacare. “We're working hard to get it in the bill. We're very hopeful, negotiations seem to be going quite well   …     We want to make a good budget that meets our principles   …     so far, so good,” he said, according to a report from BNA. com. Democrats will pay a price for obstructing Trump's priorities, Mulvaney warned. If [Democrats] tell us to pound sand, I think that's probably a disappointing indicator of where the next four years is going to go. If they tell us, however, that they recognize that President Trump won an election, and he should get some of his priorities funded for that reason, elections have consequences, as folks who win always like to say. ” For months, GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have declined to champion funding Trump's wall in the 2017 budget supplemental, which is due April 28. Trump has asked for roughly $1 billion to install or upgrade roughly 60 miles of border walls and fences this year.  GOP leaders are reluctant to fund the wall, in part, because they don't want to trade some of their budget priorities to persuade the Democrats to compromise on their   opposition to Trump's wall. Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall, which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers, cheap workers, and future voters into   cities.  Also, GOP leaders know their business donors oppose the wall, which would reduce the inflow of   consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States. Democrats know the GOP leaders are not willing to champion's Trump's wall, so they are escalating their opposition to Trump's wall and his border reforms, such as greater enforcement of current laws. For example, Democrats are threatening to block all budget funding  —   and so shut down many government agencies  —   unless they get their way.  On Wednesday, Schumer said all extra immigration funding should be held up until the next round of budget debates in the fall of 2017.  “We think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there's votes and discussion and nothing should be shoved down people's throats and that would apply to the many immigration issues that are before us, not just the wall,” Schumer said in a press call. BNA reported:  Billions of dollars for the wall and other funds that Trump wants to boost enforcement have emerged among the “poison pill” riders that Schumer said could threaten passage of the omnibus by the time federal money runs out at midnight April 28. The government is operating under a stopgap continuing resolution because only one of the 12 fiscal 2017 bills was enacted last fall. Schumer suggested that Democrats have considerable leverage in the talks over the details of the omnibus, which have continued during lawmakers'   recess. “Our Republican colleagues know they control the House, the Senate, the White House [and] a shutdown would fall on their shoulders and they don't want it,” Schumer said. On multiple occasions, GOP leader Ryan has said the Trump wall will be funded in the 2018 budget starting in October, while hinting it will get little funding for construction in 2017.  This month, Officials at the Department of Homeland Security  However, officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been told by GOP budget leaders that they can reprogram some of their existing funds to pay for construction of prototype wall designs in June.  In his Wednesday call with reporters, Schumer gloated that the GOP leaders are not supporting Trump's budget request.  “I think there's agreement, quiet agreement in the [GOP and Democratic budget leaders] that if the president doesn't interfere and insist on poison pill amendments [funding for the wall] to be shoved down the throats of the Congress, we can come up with an agreement. ” Follow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart. com",

         "Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court - The New York Times",
         "Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Mark Landler",
         "WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Tuesday nominated Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, elevating a conservative in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to succeed the late jurist and touching off a brutal, partisan showdown at the start of his presidency over the ideological bent of the nation's highest court. Mr. Trump announced his selection during a   evening ceremony that unfolded in prime time at the White House. He described Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge based in Denver, as “a man who our country really needs, and needs badly, to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. ” “Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support,” Mr. Trump said, standing beside the judge and his wife, Louise, as White House officials and Republican lawmakers looked on. “It is an extraordinary résumé  —   as good as it gets. ” But Democrats  —   embittered by Republican refusals for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama's choice to succeed Justice Scalia, and inflamed by Mr. Trump's aggressive moves at the start of his tenure  —   promised a showdown over Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Joined by liberal groups that plotted for weeks to fight Mr. Trump's eventual nominee, leading Democrats signaled they would work to turn the Supreme Court dispute into a referendum on the president, and what they contend is his disregard for legal norms and the Constitution. Conservatives and business groups cheered Judge Gorsuch, calling his record distinguished and his qualifications unparalleled. The announcement came at a particularly tumultuous moment in an extraordinarily chaotic beginning to Mr. Trump's presidency. Just a day earlier, he dismissed the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his   immigration order that started a furor across the United States over what critics condemned as a visa ban against Muslims. “Now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights and will stand up to a president who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,” Mr. Schumer said. He said he would insist that Judge Gorsuch meet the   threshold needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster for his confirmation to move forward. That would either require eight Democrats to join the Senate's 52 Republicans to advance the nomination, or force Republicans to escalate a parliamentary showdown  —   as Mr. Trump has already urged them to do  —   to change longstanding rules and push through his nominee on a simple majority vote. Republicans and conservative groups signaled they relished a war over Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. “I hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an    vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four   nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. He noted that the Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch without opposition in 2006 to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Carrie Severino, the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that immediately started a $10 million campaign to defend Mr. Trump's nominee, said the coalition would mount intensive campaigns in crucial states to “force vulnerable senators to choose between obstructing and keeping their Senate seats. ” If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would become the 113th justice and take a seat held not only by Justice Scalia, but also by Justice Robert H. Jackson, perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court. As an Episcopalian, Judge Gorsuch would be the only Protestant seated among five Catholics and three Jewish jurists. He would restore the    split between conservatives and liberals on the court, returning the swing vote to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose rulings have fallen on both sides of the political spectrum. At 49, Judge Gorsuch (pronounced  ) is the youngest nominee to the Supreme Court in 25 years, underscoring his potential to shape major decisions for decades to come. In choosing him, Mr. Trump reached for a reliably conservative figure in Justice Scalia's mold, but not someone known to be divisive. Mr. Trump, who recognized Justice Scalia's wife, Maureen, in the audience as he announced his choice, heaped praise on the “late, great” jurist, saying his “image and genius was in my mind throughout the   process. ” Judge Gorsuch said he was humbled by his “most solemn assignment. ” “I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country,” he said. He also praised Justice Scalia as “a lion of the law. ” The announcement reopened the bitter wounds that dominated the political battle last year over Mr. Obama's nominee for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans refused to even consider  —   much less support  —   his nomination in the thick of a presidential campaign. A Colorado native who was in the same class at Harvard Law School as Mr. Obama, Judge Gorsuch is known for his   measured opinions that are normally, though not exclusively, conservative. He holds a doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar, and was a Supreme Court law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Kennedy. That Judge Gorsuch has a personal connection to Justice Kennedy is no accident. By choosing a familiar figure, several officials said, the White House is sending a reassuring signal to Justice Kennedy, 80, who has been mulling retirement. Choosing a more ideologically extreme candidate, the officials said, could have tempted Justice Kennedy to hang on to his seat for several more years, depriving Mr. Trump of another seat to fill. Still, Judge Gorsuch's conservative credentials are not in doubt. He has voted in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, who invoked religious objections for refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to their female workers. And he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than the legislature to achieve policy goals. “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives,” he said on Tuesday. “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ” Judge Gorsuch is the son of Anne Gorsuch Burford, who became the first female head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, outside Washington, before going to Columbia University. There had been some speculation that Mr. Trump would choose someone with a less elite background for the court. The other finalist for the post, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and helped pay for his education by driving a taxi. The White House stoked suspense over Mr. Trump's court choice in the hours before announcing it. A senior Trump administration official said both Judge Gorsuch and Judge Hardiman were summoned to Washington for the nomination ceremony. But only Judge Gorsuch appeared at the White House gathering shortly after 8 p. m. In an allusion to the intense foreshadowing he and his team did to encourage interest and speculation over the pick, Mr. Trump interrupted his own announcement to marvel at his showmanship: “So was that a surprise?” the president said after announcing Judge Gorsuch's name. “Was it?” As he looked out into an audience that Democrats had refused to join  —   several senior lawmakers declined his invitation to attend the East Room ceremony  —   the president expressed hope that he could avoid a partisan battle. “I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once, for the good of the country,” Mr. Trump said. But progressive groups had already gathered at the steps of the Supreme Court to protest a nominee they predicted would be extreme. Nan Aron of the   Alliance for Justice called Judge Gorsuch “a disastrous choice,” adding that his record showed “no sign that he would offer an independent check on the dangerous impulses of this administration. ” Conservatives were as ardent in their support. Tom Fitton, the president of the   group Judicial Watch, called Mr. Trump's nomination “a major step in the right direction in defining his presidency and moving the Supreme Court away from dangerous and destructive judicial activism. ”",

         "Posted on November 9, 2016 by DavidSwanson \nDear Democrats, \nAre you finding yourselves suddenly a bit doubtful of the wisdom of drone wars? Presidential wars without Congress? Massive investment in new, smaller, “more usable” nuclear weapons? The expansion of bases across Africa and Asia? Are you disturbed by the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen? Can total surveillance and the persecution of whistleblowers hit a point where they've gone too far? Is the new Cold War with Russia looking less than ideal now? How about the militarization of U.S. police: is it time to consider alternatives to that? \nI hear you. I'm with you. Let's build a movement together to end the madness of constantly overthrowing governments with bombs. Let's propose nonviolent alternatives to a culture gone mad with war. Let's end the mindset that creates war in the first place . \nWe have opportunities as well as dangers. A President Trump is unpredictable. He wants to proliferate nuclear weapons, bomb people, kill people, stir up hatred of people, and increase yet further military spending. But he also said the new Cold War was a bad idea. He said he wanted to end NATO, not to mention NAFTA, as well as breaking the habit of overthrowing countries left and right. Trump seems to immediately back off such positions under the slightest pressure. Will he adhere to them under massive pressure from across the political spectrum? It's worth a try . \nWe have an opportunity to build a movement that includes a focus on and participation from refugees/immigrants. We have a chance to create opposition to racist wars and racism at home. We may just discover that what's left of the U.S. labor movement is suddenly more open to opposing wars. Environmental groups may find a willingness to oppose the world's top destroyer of the environment: the U.S. military. Civil liberties groups may at long last be willing to take on the militarism that creates the atrocities they oppose. We have to work for such a broader movement. We have to build on the trend of protesting the national anthem and make it a trend of actively resisting the greatest purveyor of violence on earth. \nI know you're feeling a little beat down at the moment. You shouldn't. You had a winning candidate in Bernie Sanders. Your party cheated him out of the nomination. All that stuff you tell yourselves about encouraging demographic trends and the better positions of young people is all true. You just looked for love in all the wrong places. Running an unpopular candidate in a broken election system is not the way to change the world. Even a working election system would not be the central means by which to improve anything. There's no getting back the mountains of money and energy invested in this election. But activism is an unlimited resource. Directing your energies now in more strategic directions can inspire others who in turn can re-inspire you. \n\nDear Republicans, \nYour outsider is threatening insiderness. He's got the same tribe of DC corporate lobbyists planning his nominations that Hillary Clinton had lined up for hers. Can we resist that trend? Can we insist that the wars be ended? Can those moments of off-the-cuff honesty about dinosaurs like NATO be turned into actual action? Donald Trump took a lot of heat for proposing to be fair to Palestinians as well as Israelis, and he backed off fast. Can we encourage him to stand behind that initial inclination? \nCan we stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership and end NAFTA as well? We heard a million speeches about how bad NAFTA is. How about actually ending it? Can we stop the looming war supplemental spending bill? Can we put a swift halt to efforts in Congress to repeal the right to sue Saudi Arabia and other nations for their wars and lesser acts of terrorism? \nHow about all that well deserved disgust with the corporate media? Can we actually break up that cartel and allow opportunities for media entrepreneurs? \n\nDear United States, \nDonald Trump admitted we had a broken election system and for a while pretended that he would operate outside of it by funding his own campaign. It's time to actually fix it. It's time to end the system of legalized bribery, fund elections, make registration automatic, make election day a holiday, end gerrymandering, eliminate the electoral college, create the right to vote, create the public hand-counting of paper ballots at every polling place, and create ranked choice voting as Maine just did. \nVoter suppression efforts in this year's elections should be prosecuted in each state. And any indications of fraud in vote counting by machines should be investigated. We should take the opportunity created by all the McCarthyist nonsense allegations of Russian interference to get rid of unverifiable voting. \nThere are also areas in which localities and states, as well as international organizations and alliances, must now step up to take the lead. First and foremost is investing in a serious effort to avoid climate catastrophe. Second is addressing inequality that has surpassed the Middle Ages: both taxing the overclass and upholding the underclass must be pursued creatively. Mass incarceration and militarized police are problems that states can solve. \nBut we can advance a positive agenda across the board by understanding this election in the way that much of the world will understand it: as a vote against endless war. Let's end the wars, end the weapons dealing, close the bases, and cut the $1 trillion a year going into the military. Hell, why not demand that a businessman president for the first time ever audit the Pentagon and find out what it's spending money on? \n\nDear World, \nWe apologize for having elected President Trump as well as for nearly electing President Clinton. Many of you believe we defeated the representative of the enlightenment in favor of the sexist racist buffoon. This may be a good thing. Or at least it may be preferable to your eight-year-long delusion that President Obama was a man of peace and justice. \nI hate to break it to you, but the United States government has been intent on dominating the rest of you since the day it was formed. If electing an obnoxious president helps you understand that, so much the better. Stop joining in U.S. “humanitarian wars” please. They never were humanitarian, and if you can recognize that now, so much the better. The new guy openly wants to “steal their oil.” So did the last several presidents, although none of them said so. Are we awake now? \nShut down the U.S. bases in your country. They represent your subservience to Donald Trump. Close them. \nWant to save the earth's climate? Build a nonviolent movement that resists destructive agendas coming out of the United States. \nWant to uphold the rule of law, diplomacy, aid, decency, and humanitarianism? Stop making exceptions for U.S. crimes. Tell the International Criminal Court to indict a non-African. Prosecute the crime and crimes of war in your own courts. Stop cooperating in the surrounding and threatening of Russia, China, and Iran. Clinton wanted to send weapons to Ukraine and bomb Syria. Make sure Trump doesn't. Make peace in Ukraine and Syria before January. \nIt's time that we all began treating the institution of war as the unacceptable vestige of barbarism that it can appear when given an openly racist, sexist, bigoted face. We have the ability to use nonviolent tools to direct the world where we want it to go. We have to stop believing the two big lies: that we are generally powerless, and that our only power lies in elections. Let's finally get active. Let's start by ending war making .

         "AWR Hawkins",
         "A U. S. Navy littoral combat ship (LCS) was commissioned Saturday in honor of gun control proponent Gabby Giffords. [Giffords is a former U. S. Congresswoman who has been pushing for background checks since being shot on January 8, 2011, by a man who passed a background check to acquire his gun. On March 4, 2015, Breitbart News reported Giffords' position that every   gun owner should have to pass the same background check her attacker passed.  According to 10 News, the Honorable Sean Stackley, acting Secretary of the Navy, issued a statement on the commissioning, saying, “The commissioning of USS Gabrielle Giffords adds the advanced capability of a versatile warship to our nation's growing fleet. Today's ceremony is also a testament to the skill and dedication of our nation's remarkable shipbuilders, who will be remembered for decades to come as LCS 10 deploys around the world to protect our freedoms. ” The home port for the USS Gabrielle Giffords will be San Diego. On February 10, 2012, the Washington Post reported the Navy's announcement that a ship was to be built in Giffords' honor. The announcement came hours after Giffords had joined President Obama as he signed legislation she had supported prior to being shot and resigning her seat in Congress.

         "Bombing Suspect Pleads Not Guilty in Shootout With New Jersey Officers - The New York Times",
         "Joseph Goldstein",
         "ELIZABETH, N. J.  —   More than three weeks after the bombings in New York City and at the Jersey Shore, the man accused in the attacks pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges relating to the attempted murder of police officers. The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, who appeared in Superior Court here via video conference from his bed at University Hospital in Newark, said little, generally giving   answers to questions. Mr. Rahami, 28, has been in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds since his capture on Sept. 19 in Linden, N. J. It was the public's first glimpse of Mr. Rahami since he was loaded into an ambulance after a shootout with officers that ended a search for the person responsible for planting bombs here, in Seaside Park, N. J. and in Manhattan. One of the bombs, planted under a trash bin on 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, exploded on Sept. 17, injuring 31 people. Earlier that day, an explosive detonated in a trash can in Seaside Park, where a   race had been scheduled. Another blast occurred as a robot was trying to disarm explosives left in the trash at the train station in Elizabeth. A fourth bomb was found in Chelsea, but it did not detonate. Charges relating to the bombings have been filed in federal court, although Mr. Rahami has not been arraigned on them. It is rare for so much time to pass between a defendant's arrest and his first appearance in court. But in the days after Mr. Rahami's capture, state prosecutors opposed an effort by public defenders to visit him, saying that he was “incapacitated and unable to communicate” and therefore unable to assert his right to a counsel. Little has been said about Mr. Rahami's health. He was shot several times after he fired on officers who had discovered him asleep in the vestibule of a bar. But on Thursday, he could be seen reclining in a hospital bed, his head propped up by a pillow. A white sheet was draped over his body, concealing the extent of his injuries. In a soft voice, Mr. Rahami answered “yes” to a few routine questions from the judge: Was he able to hear what the judge was saying? Had he seen a copy of the criminal charges? One of his lawyers, Peter Liguori, did much of the talking, as he stood over Mr. Rahami's bed, in a yellow hospital gown and blue gloves. Mr. Liguori said Mr. Rahami would be pleading not guilty to each of the charges. “I will enter a not guilty plea, of course, on all the charges,” the judge, Regina Caulfield, said before setting bail at $5. 2 million. Judge Caulfield outlined the charges Mr. Rahami faces in state court, the most serious of which were the attempted murder of five police officers. None were seriously injured. He is accused of shooting one officer in the torso, although that officer was spared serious injury because of his body armor. It is not known when Mr. Rahami will be formally arraigned in federal court on   charges. An   naturalized United States citizen, he is said by federal prosecutors to have taken his inspiration from “Brother Osama bin Laden” and other international terrorists, including members of the Islamic State, according to a criminal complaint and a notebook he had when he was apprehended. Still, much about his radicalization remains unknown. Mr. Rahami spent hours watching videos on the internet espousing violent jihad, frightening his father, Mohammad Rahami, who confronted his son and said he shared his concerns with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after his son had been arrested on assault charges in a domestic violence case. But Mr. Rahami's radicalization does not appear to have occurred entirely in his bedroom, above the family's fried chicken restaurant here. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan for extended periods in recent years. He returned home from one yearlong trip in 2014, noticeably angry, friends and relatives have said. His family grew concerned that he may have come under the sway of a radical cleric while living in Quetta, Pakistan, where the Rahami family has relatives.",

         "Theresa May Is Poised to Be Britain's Next Prime Minister - The New York Times",
         "Stephen Castle",
         "LONDON  —   Theresa May emerged on Monday as Britain's next prime minister, becoming the second woman, after Margaret Thatcher, to hold that post. She faces multiple challenges as soon as she takes office, from negotiating the nation's departure from the European Union to addressing deep social and political divisions to reviving a wounded economy. Her victory came on another day of rapid developments in British politics and set in motion a process that officials said would put her in 10 Downing Street by Wednesday night, succeeding David Cameron. Ms. May, until now Britain's home secretary, is set to take over at a time of immense upheaval. The nation must not only negotiate its withdrawal from the European Union, a process fraught with economic and political risks, but it must also hold itself together amid a renewed clamor from Scotland for independence. Early signs are that Britain's economy has already taken a substantial hit from the exit vote, or “Brexit. ” A Conservative like Mrs. Thatcher, who governed from 1979 to 1990, Ms. May, 59, has won a reputation for steeliness in her tenure as home secretary. She has pledged to negotiate a deal to leave the European Union that would reassert Britain's ability to control immigration, a central issue in the referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the bloc. Yet unlike Mrs. Thatcher, Ms. May is seen as a relative moderate and on Monday she promised to address inequality, give workers greater representation on corporate boards and limit tax cuts. Ms. May said that she was “honored and humbled” to be chosen for the job, promised to get the best deal over Britain's exit from the European Union, and vowed to create an economy that works not for the “privileged few,” but for all. The British referendum on June 23 plunged the European Union into crisis. It left Britain rudderless as the pound sank in value and both the governing and opposition parties engaged in fierce and acrimonious leadership battles. Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday. After making a brief statement describing his successor as “strong” and “competent,” Mr. Cameron was caught on a microphone humming as he returned to his office. Mr. Cameron's statement completed a day of high political drama in which Ms. May's rival for the Conservative Party leadership, Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, withdrew from the race. Leading party members quickly coalesced around Ms. May, insisting that the contest should not be reopened. A party committee agreed. Ms. Leadsom had already faced accusations  —   which she denied  —   of embellishing her curriculum vitae, but her campaign ran aground over the weekend after The Times of London published an interview in which she suggested that she was a better candidate because she is a mother, while Ms. May is not. Surrounded by supportive lawmakers, Ms. Leadsom on Monday made no reference to that issue, but said that she was quitting the contest and endorsing Ms. May, and that she hoped to see her installed as prime minister “as soon as possible. ” The turn of events meant that Ms. May would become prime minister without a general election and without completing the campaign she and Ms. Leadsom had been waging for the endorsement of the Conservative Party's    members. Last week, the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke described Ms. May as a “bloody difficult woman,” noting that he had worked for another female politician of similar temperament, namely Mrs. Thatcher. Far from being insulted, Ms. May used the comment to suggest that her negotiating stance with European officials would be as tough as that of Mrs. Thatcher, who went into battle on the Continent, particularly over British financial contributions to the bloc. “Ken Clarke might have found me to be a ‘bloody difficult woman.' The next person to find that out will be   Juncker,” she told fellow Conservative lawmakers, referring to the president of the European Commission, the bloc's executive, ITV reported. But in a speech on Monday, Ms. May outlined an economic agenda unlike that of Mrs. Thatcher, calling for new mechanisms to curb executive pay and warning big multinational companies that they must pay their share of taxes. Ms. May has also been compared to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany who, like Ms. May, is the daughter of a clergyman and is known for her   methodical and pragmatic approach. The   turmoil in Britain has also gripped the opposition Labour Party, prompting a challenge against its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of not campaigning hard enough against a British withdrawal from Europe. There were growing fears on Monday that the party might split because of the bitter dispute. Nevertheless, opposition politicians called for a general election and questioned Ms. May's democratic mandate, since she will assume the job on the basis of an internal transfer of power within the governing party. So far, Ms. May has rejected the notion of a quick general election. Her top priority will be to frame a negotiating strategy for leaving the union, after the referendum in which she sided with those who wanted to remain. On Monday, Ms. May insisted that “Brexit means Brexit,” as she sought to reassure   that she was committed to the policy, adding that “there will be no attempt to remain inside the E. U. There will be no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, no second referendum. ” But, while 52 percent of voters supported Brexit, they did so for differing reasons, including reasserting national sovereignty and opposition to migration from within the bloc, which guarantees the right to live and work within any member nation. Ms. May is expected to take a tough stance on immigration in part because she is politically vulnerable on the issue. As home secretary, she failed to fulfill a Conservative pledge to control the number of people arriving in Britain. The numbers persistently exceeded targets and included arrivals of   which the government had the power to curb. Ms. May has signaled her intention to restrict migration from Europe, even if doing so hurt Britain's position in negotiating a new trade deal with the bloc. She will also be under pressure from big business to secure the best possible access to Europe's single market, which normally entails accepting the principle of free movement of workers across national frontiers. One important question for Ms. May is when to invoke Article 50 of the European Union's governing treaty, which starts the withdrawal procedure. That effectively sets a   deadline for a deal to be struck. She has suggested that she intends to wait until her government has settled on its negotiating stance before invoking the article despite pressure from Europe's leaders to act more quickly. On Monday she said more about her wider political agenda in a speech that offered plans to address some of the economic and social inequalities evident in Britain. Those include populist resentments thought to have motivated many   voters in economically depressed areas outside London and in the affluent southeast of England. “There is a growing divide between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. And there is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,” she said, positioning herself in a centrist tradition of “one nation” Conservatism. Speaking in Birmingham, England, Ms. May also called for efforts to increase productivity, for employees and consumers to gain seats on company boards and for votes on executive pay to become binding rather than advisory. Big multinationals should pay their share of taxes, she said, adding: “Whether you're Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes. ”",

         "Ireland Doesn't Want Apple's Back Taxes, but the Irish Aren't So Sure - The New York Times",
         "Mark Scott",
         "CORK, Ireland  —   When European officials ordered Ireland to collect a record $14. 5 billion in back taxes from Apple, Kieran O'Connell drew up a wish list for spending the money. A public social worker who deals with   youth, Mr. O'Connell has faced drastic cuts since the Irish government imposed austerity measures six years ago during a financial crisis. His salary was frozen and his pension taxed. With his agency's budget shrunk 30 percent, he hasn't been able to replace staff, keep up with the demand for addiction and retraining programs or accommodate all the homeless teenagers looking for shelter. “You could invest it in treatment centers, detox beds and community care,” said Mr. O'Connell, 50, who works in this southern Irish city, where Apple has had its European headquarters for more than 35 years. But Ireland doesn't want Apple's billions. Instead, the Irish government is appealing Europe's tax ruling, a move that is exposing a rift in a country still feeling the aftershocks from years of harsh cutbacks. The Irish government's defense is a mixture of financial realpolitik, national pride and damage limitation. The European Union's decision takes direct aim at some of the country's generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple's case. Local lawmakers, in part, worry that taking the tech giant's billions could scare off other multinationals from investing in Ireland just as other countries vie to entice them. Many people across the country are also upset that European officials are meddling with the country's tax policies. Apple, which is also appealing, is taking the same stand, calling the case “politically motivated. ” But it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from   lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple's tax bill may rise to $21. 3 billion when interest is included. The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by   percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes. In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 percent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 percent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs. “That money could create at least 100, 000 jobs,” said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the   Alliance, a small political party. “It would have a transformative effect. ” This tug of war over Apple's money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn. Much of the country's   economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200, 000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 percent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics. And Ireland is hoping to entice even more. Countries around the region are lining up to woo companies thinking about leaving Britain after it voted in June to leave the European Union. While the Irish are eager for the jobs offered by international companies, years of   are highlighting the yawning inequalities of policies that allow the world's richest companies to sidestep billions in taxes. The improving economy only adds to the debate. Ireland has roared back from recession, but much of the recent growth is related to financial maneuvering and not longstanding improvements in the domestic economy. “A lot of people don't have a problem with government's appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?” said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork's local government. Almost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 percent less cash in his pocket. “The Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple,” Mr. Connolly added. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has been quick to defend the company's tax practices. “When you're accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out outrage in you,” he said in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the case. Cork, with a population of about 125, 000, is a contradictory blend of Silicon Valley chic and   austerity. A Starbucks in a refurbished   building on the banks of the River Lee, which meanders though the city center, attracts a techie crowd of   millennials, speaking languages as varied as Chinese and Czech.   stores like Tommy Hilfiger line the main thoroughfare, and luxury sedans carry tech and pharmaceutical executives to meetings. Yet only a few blocks away, where street stall vendors once sold fruit and vegetables, pawnshops and mostly empty casinos dot the streets. Posters at a government agency offer tips on how to deal with spiraling personal debt. A longtime port town, Cork in recent decades has made itself an attractive hub for multinationals. Companies can tap into a steady stream of graduates from the local university, along with lucrative tax breaks on any research and development carried out in the city. Rents are roughly half those in Dublin. Apple was at the leading edge of this movement, putting down roots in the early 1980s, when the company was a mere minnow in the tech world. Three decades on, Cork's suburbs are littered with newly built office parks, where   buildings are emblazoned with logos from some of the world's largest companies, like Dell Technologies, Intel and Eli Lilly and Company. Apple, with its fortresslike compound, is one of the area's largest employers. Its army of over 5, 000 workers has been a boon for the local economy, pumping in millions of dollars through income tax, rents and spending at fashionable restaurants and luxury stores. When Apple arrived, its workers mostly assembled computers and other devices. But as labor costs sent production to Asia, the company's Cork offices have now switched gears, mostly providing global customer and sales support. “Cork and Apple have stuck together through thick and thin,” said Des Cahill, the city's mayor, who will meet company executives in San Francisco this week as part of an annual trade visit to drum up new investment. “We're like an old married couple. ” Just a few minutes' walk from Apple's main campus, Cork shows a different side. Austere concrete government housing stands crumbling in the   sun. And social workers say many local residents stand little chance of landing   jobs at Apple, mostly because of a lack of   skills. In Cork's poorest neighborhoods, austerity has meant layoffs, economic uncertainty and often little support. The number of people living on the streets jumped to 345 last year compared with just 38 in 2011, according to Cork Simon, a local homeless charity. The city's annual budget has been cut by 20 percent, to $170 million, over the same period. For Charlie Harrington, a paramedic, the Apple tax standoff comes down to fairness. Like most people in Cork, Mr. Harrington, 53, said international companies  —   and the jobs they created  —   were more than welcome in the city. But he doesn't think tax rules are equally applied. When he recently refused to pay a new property tax, authorities took the money directly from his paycheck. If the government was so quick to penalize his   tax avoidance, Mr. Harrington asked, then how could it protect Apple? “If the big guys don't pay and the government helps them, then everyone else will ask why we are paying too,” he said over a cup of tea in a living room decorated with family photos. “They owe the money, so they should just pay it. ”",

         "Trump Immigration Policies Pose Conflict for Police in ‘Sanctuary Cities' - The New York Times",
         "Farah Stockman and J. David Goodman",
         "President Trump's sweeping new immigration policies  —   which include efforts to shine a harsh national spotlight on cities that released undocumented immigrants who went on to be accused of serious crimes  —   are sharply increasing the legal and political risks confronting local law enforcement officials. As Mr. Trump ratchets up the pressure on   sanctuary cities through what some advocates are denouncing as a “  ” campaign to force them to work more closely with federal immigration authorities, police and sheriff's departments are being caught in a crossfire. In Denver, Sheriff Patrick Firman, who runs the local jail, has long received one set of instructions from the   city government and local advocates. The city attorney warned him against detaining anyone without a warrant. The American Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue him if he did. Immigrants' rights groups applied the added deterrent of local political pressure. So Mr. Firman's department began doing what many law enforcement officers around the country have learned to do: balance contradictory requests. When the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wants to deport one of his inmates, the jail sends a fax notifying ICE before the inmate is about to walk free  —   leaving it to federal agents to show up and make an arrest. But the fax is not necessarily sent with a great deal of advance notice. In the case of Ever Valles, 19, a Mexican national awaiting trial for car theft, the Denver jail's fax was sent in the middle of the night in late December, 10 hours after Mr. Valles posted bail but less than a   before he walked free. ICE was nowhere to be seen. Last Friday, Mr. Valles was charged with a much more serious crime: murdering a man at a light rail station in a robbery gone awry. Now, Mr. Firman is in the eye of a political storm that highlights the precarious position confronting many law enforcement officials. Immigration officials accused Mr. Firman of ignoring their detainer request. “Had the officer for ICE been sitting at the fax machine, waiting for it to come in, it still would not have been enough time for us to come and get him,” said Shawn Neudauer, an ICE spokesman. The Fox News host Bill O'Reilly declared that Mr. Firman and Denver's mayor had “blood on their hands. ” Angry messages quickly began flooding the sheriff's department and its social media pages. Mr. Firman declined to be interviewed. Officials at the jail, which releases about 100 people a day and receives three to five detainer requests a week, say they try their best to cooperate with immigration officials and to notify them in a timely manner, despite calls from local advocates not to communicate with the agency and to release undocumented immigrants through a side door to elude federal agents. The Trump administration hopes the firestorm will help shift public opinion in cities that have vowed to protect their undocumented populations. Yet, the attacks on Mr. Firman do not acknowledge the confusing and often conflicting rules that have led to complaints by the law enforcement agents. United States appeals courts have ruled that federal detainer requests are not a substitute for a warrant or for the probable cause required to get one. “You can't just pick up the phone and say, ‘Please hold an individual,'” said Jonathan F. Thompson, executive director of the   National Sheriffs' Association. When federal officials began issuing detainers in 2008 under a pilot program called Secure Communities, most jurisdictions treated the requests as mandatory. But after American citizens were mistakenly held, filed suit and won costly damage awards, some jurisdictions stopped cooperating. More confusion occurred when cities and states adopted their own policies spelling out when to turn over undocumented immigrants. As compliance with detainers dropped sharply, the Obama administration ended the program and introduced a new one allowing local jurisdictions far more leeway to decide when to cooperate. But that has caused even more confusion among law enforcement officials, when what they want is clarity about their obligations, Mr. Thompson said. He said his members were relieved this week when Mr. Trump reinstated the Secure Communities program. But Mr. Thompson said the rules surrounding federal detainers were still “a work in progress. ” It remains to be seen how the reinstated program will avoid the same legal setbacks that took the program down under President Obama. “We're all trying to figure out how to do that as quickly as possible,” Mr. Thompson said, mentioning a meeting he and some of his members had recently with Mr. Trump. Recent clashes between local and federal officials have only muddied the waters. In New York City this week, ICE officials publicly assailed the city government after an undocumented Salvadoran teenager with suspected ties to a violent gang, Estivan Rafael Marques Velasquez, was released from Rikers Island despite a federal request for assistance with his deportation. “Honoring a detainer request is not about politics,” Thomas R. Decker, director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE in New York, said in a news release. “It is about keeping New York citizens safe. ” But the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, vigorously defends that policy, adopted by the City Council in 2014, under which only those accused of 170 serious felonies  —   such as arson, robbery or homicide  —   can be turned over to immigration enforcement agents. And in a radio interview last month, the mayor suggested that turning local police into a deportation force would make the city more dangerous because fewer people would report crimes or cooperate with investigations. “If so many of our fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented feared to communicate with the local authorities because they thought they might be deported, we couldn't run our city,” he said. The case of Mr. Velasquez, 18, who has been arrested six times since 2014 on charges that remain sealed because he was a minor at the time, highlights how quickly public opinion can shift if an undocumented immigrant commits a serious crime. A trenchant New York Post headline  —   “ ‘Sanctuary City' Law Let Gang Member Walk Free From Rikers”  —   lit up social media as Trump supporters across the country railed against New York's defiance. The prospect of more such cases being publicized has rattled New York officials. “I don't think that litigating this in the public sphere is the best path forward,” said Nisha Agarwal, the city's commissioner for immigrant affairs. Mr. Velasquez  —   known to city officials as Steven Marquez  —   was involved in a clash last year between youths outside Queens County Criminal Courthouse witnesses told investigators they heard gunshots. He was charged with felony weapons possession, which would have made him eligible to be handed over to ICE under New York City's policy. But he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor,   weapons possession. He served less than a year at Rikers Island, where investigators noted that he had a tattoo associating him with the Salvadoran gang  . On Feb. 16, he was released from jail. Hours later, he was rearrested by federal agents at a Queens apartment, according to ICE, whose agents say it is far more dangerous to arrest someone on the streets than in jail. To highlight the additional risks they say they must take in sanctuary cities, ICE agents make a point of issuing news releases that criticize jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with deportations. That kind of   warfare is almost certain to escalate. This week, the Department of Homeland Security ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release weekly reports of crimes committed by immigrants who were the subjects of detainer requests that went ignored. Some sanctuary cities view the move as beyond the pale. “This is a shaming list, a scarlet letter that the federal government is going to put on jurisdictions around the country,” said Dennis Herrera, San Francisco's city attorney. “We welcome an open and honest discussion about immigration and crime, because numerous studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be incarcerated than   individuals. ” But Mr. Thompson, of the National Sheriffs' Association, said the effort was merely meant to illuminate the constraints under which law enforcement agencies are operating. The new directive “wasn't written in a way to shame anyone,” he said. “It was written in a way to give the department a handle on, ‘Why can't these criminal aliens be held? Is it state law or local law preventing a sheriff from cooperating? '”",

         "OMB Director Mulvaney: Americans 1st Budget Increases Defense, Border Security, Education Funding, Cuts at State Department and EPA",
         "Michelle Moons",
         "WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   On Wednesday Director Mick Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget gave some insight into the shift in department funding of President Donald Trump's “America First Budget” ahead of its Thursday release. [“This is the America First Budget,” Mulvaney told reporters at a White House briefing. “In fact we wrote it using the President's own words. We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies. We talked to him and we wanted to know what his policies were and we turned those policies into numbers. ”  Mulvaney said increases like the $54 billion increase to the Defense Department would be offset in other areas of the budget blueprint to prevent any further increases in the budget deficit. The Director made clear that this does not mean that the budget is balanced. “There's more money for enforcing security at the border. There's more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. There's more money for things like private and public school choice. ” The State Department and and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will also see cuts according to Mulvaney. He went on to say that reductions in the State Department were not a reflection of the President's support, but rather that areas like foreign aid that face cuts, simply fall under the State Department portion of the budget. The State Department reductions will be around 28 percent according to Mulvaney. Mulvaney went on to state that the budget being released is not a full budget, but rather a blueprint and only deals with the portion of the budget that makes up discretionary spending. He said that those who oversee the various departments are being given great flexibility in managing funds within their own departments. He also stated that the core functions and beyond of the EPA can be satisfied with the dollars included in this budget. Asked if the budget assumes passage of the House Republican Leadership's American Health Care Act, Mulvaney said generally no, adding that will be dealt with in a budget to be released in May. The budget to be released on Thursday morning will also show suggestion for ending funding for public broadcasting according to Mulvaney. NASA will see a very slight reduction in funding around one percent, but Mulvaney was clear that some areas within that area of the budget will see increases. He said space exploration remains among the President's priorities. This budget will not be a    spreadsheet. Mulvaney said that the budget will show money allocated for moving forward with building a wall along the U. S. southern border. He said that the budget in May will show more, but that this budget includes allocation for pilot cases to find most cost efficient, safest and most effective ways to complete the wall. Director Mulvaney said that the budget will be available online starting at 7 a. m. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",

         "Earth Sets a Temperature Record for the Third Straight Year - The New York Times",
         "Justin Gillis",
         "Marking another milestone for a changing planet, scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016, trouncing a record set only a year earlier, which beat one set in 2014. It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row. The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor's efforts to cut emissions of   gases. In reality, the Earth is heating up, a point long beyond serious scientific dispute, but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling. Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization. In 2015 and 2016, the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the   trend of rising temperatures, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. “A single warm year is something of a curiosity,” said Deke Arndt, chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It's really the trend, and the fact that we're punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that we're undergoing big changes. ” The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years, and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems, such as rapid coastal erosion, caused by the changing climate. “What's going on in the Arctic is really very impressive this year was ridiculously off the chart,” said Gavin A. Schmidt, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures. But Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat. Drought and starvation afflicted Africa. On May 19, the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India, 123. 8 degrees Fahrenheit. El Niño has now ended, and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before. But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years. Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored. The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and   weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis. In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA's. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason. NASA's calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a   Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016. That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years, and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a   period in the NASA record, which begins in 1880. The findings about a   year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments. That group, however, did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014. In addition to the surface measurements, satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface. Two groups that analyze these figures showed a   2016 in data going back to 1978, though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin. Since 1880, NOAA's records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row: in 1939, 1940 and 1941. The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades, however, that 1941 now ranks as only the   year on record. The modern era of global warming began around 1970, after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures, and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row. Of the 17 hottest years on record, 16 have now occurred since 2000. Two of the agencies that issued Wednesday's figures, NOAA and NASA, will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by   Donald J. Trump, who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science. In 2012, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing noncompetitive. ” Fear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation. Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees have given no detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are likely to be, much less how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate. Since he was elected president, Mr. Trump has acknowledged there may be “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change, and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject. On Wednesday, in questioning before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said, “I do not believe that climate change is a hoax. ” He did not, however, say whether he believed that Mr. Trump was wrong on climate change. The three   years in a row undercut longstanding claims by a handful of contrarian scientists that global warming stopped after 1998. That argument was never backed by good statistical evidence, but it was highlighted repeatedly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016. When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly. Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400, 000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day. It is true that at the Earth's surface, the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts. “The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,” said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the   Earth Observatory of Columbia University. “It never stopped. ” In fact, the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago. Those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring   emissions under control. For example, many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, though they cannot say how fast it will happen. A rise that large would drown most of the world's coastal cities without heroic efforts to fortify them.",

         "Nick Hallett",
         "Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is to be a “close but unofficial” advisor to U. S. President Donald Trump, the Governor of Mississippi has said. [Speaking at a party thrown for Mr Farage on the top floor of the Hay Adams hotel, Phil Bryant said: “There is an opportunity for him to work directly with the president, we call it ‘close but unofficial'.  “I think you will see that type of relationship between Nigel Farage and the president where he will turn to Nigel for advice about Great Britain. ” The Telegraph quotes Mr Bryant as adding: “I don't want to speak for the president but I know that the president has a great deal of trust in Nigel Farage, and I think he is going to turn to him as an adviser and there would be none better. ” He described the former UKIP leader as a “humble man who just believes in Great Britain and trying to make sure it achieves that greatness”. Mr Bryant added that Brexit will be a massive boost for Britain, saying: “I remind all our friends here  —   there is a reason they call it Great Britain. It is going to be great again. ” Mr Farage spoke at the same event, saying how he was “proud” to have played a part in Donald Trump's election. “At times it wasn't necessarily that easy to be helping the Trump campaign,” he said. “There were one or two low moments. But I think what's exciting is that 2016 will be looked at in ten years' time, in a hundred years' time, as a year of a great pivot, of a great change. “A year when nation state democracy reasserted itself. A year when proper decent values reasserted themselves. And I think through 2017 much of this revolution will continue across much of what is left of Mr. Juncker's European Union. ”",

         "Their Hair Fell Out. Should the F.D.A. Have the Power to Act? - The New York Times",
         "Eric Lipton and Rachel Abrams",
         "WASHINGTON  —   When the Los Angeles hairstylist Chaz Dean pitched his almond mint and   hair care products  —   endorsed by celebrities like Brooke Shields and Alyssa Milano  —   he sold millions. But his formula got an unexpected result: itching, rashes, even hair loss in large clumps, in both adults and children. More than 21, 000 complaints have been lodged against his Wen Hair Care, and  Mr. Dean, the     stylist to the stars, has found himself at the center of a fierce debate over the government's power to ensure the safety of a cosmetics industry with about $50 billion in annual sales. The Santa Monica, Calif.  national distributor of Mr. Dean's hair care line is part of a beauty care trade association that has been aggressively lobbying Congress to block the passage of tough new legislation that would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to test ingredients used in cosmetics and issue mandatory recalls for products found to be unsafe. The fight has pitted smaller independent players against the giants of the beauty products industry, which back the proposed regulations, seeing them as an avenue toward regaining public trust, and have the size and muscle to comply with them. Each side has its champions in Congress: Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, for the larger companies, and Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, coming to the aid of his   company, Mary Kay, which joined the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors to fight the   legislation. Mr. Sessions has introduced competing legislation backed and largely drafted by Mary Kay and the independent companies. “If you are in business and are not involved in politics, then politics will run your business,” explained a presentation prepared by Mary Kay last summer for sales representatives and obtained by The New York Times. The   comes amid growing consumer concern about the safety of beauty care products and follows a string of other scares, including the discovery of hair products and skin creams containing hazardous ingredients such as formaldehyde and mercury. “People don't realize there is effectively no regulation of cosmetics,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. Democrat of New Jersey. He, along with Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Collins, has pushed to strengthen a 1938 law that was passed to regulate the pharmaceutical industry but contained two pages that addressed cosmetics, leaving it essentially unregulated. Joe Hixson, a spokesman for   the distributor of Wen, said the company has “evidence and studies that we believe demonstrate Wen is safe and does not cause hair loss. ” Mr. Dean's hair care product does not actually lather. Instead, Mr. Dean promotes it as “a revolutionary way to cleanse” the hair without the use of traditional detergents or sulfates, chemicals some consumers have objected to. “In addition to it sounding like ‘Zen,' the system is a completely reverse way of looking at cleansing the hair,” the product's website boasts. “Thus, ‘Wen' is ‘new' spelled backwards. ” The company also sells what it calls “unique formulations gentle for pediatric use. ” Miriam Lawrence of Denver said she used Wen's Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner on the hair of her daughter, Eliana, then 9, about three times in late 2014. Within days, her daughter's brush was full of hair. Three weeks later, Eliana was bald. “It changed our life in just a couple shampoos. It's ridiculous,” said Ms. Lawrence, whose daughter has grown back most of her hair and eyebrows. “It was marketed to be extra gentle, no harsh chemicals. ” Mr. Pallone, in a letter to the F. D. A. and   has pressed for answers about the Wen case. And in an interview he cited it as an example of why current law is failing and more rigorous regulation is needed. For legal reasons, the government's hands are tied. That is in part because unlike pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic companies are not required to notify the government of “adverse reaction” reports  —   even if someone dies. The F. D. A. instead has had to depend on consumers stepping forward, and as of July 7, only 127 reports had been filed to the agency detailing problems with the Wen hair care line. But inspectors sent to the company's facilities dating back to 2011 learned that complaints to the company and distributor total more than 21, 000, the agency said last month. “You know how the stars were saying it was so good and it made your hair more manageable, more shinier?” said Bonnie Iqbal, 55, of Albany, who last year was among those who sued the company after her hair began falling out. “So I figured, you know, I'd try it. ” Patricia J. Zettler, a health law and policy expert at Georgia State University and a former F. D. A. lawyer, said that under existing law, the agency could take action against the company only if it could prove a product had been mislabeled or contaminated. If the product turns out to be dangerous but legal, the government has no recourse. “The bottom line is, if the company has not violated the law, there isn't really anything F. D. A. can do,” Ms. Zettler said. Even in the absence of federal action,   in a “business decision,” agreed in late June to a $26. 25 million legal settlement  —   still not approved by a federal court judge  —   that would repay up to $25 to every person who has bought a bottle since Wen products were introduced and as much as $20, 000 to individuals claiming hair loss or other injury. Yet the product is still being sold, and the F. D. A. other than issuing a notice saying it is looking at the matter, has taken no action. The   bill is intended to eliminate such stalemates. It would, for the first time, require that cosmetics manufacturers report “serious adverse” reactions to their products to the F. D. A. as they come in, as well as create an annual report of all “adverse events. ” It would also give the agency the power to order companies to recall products found to be dangerous. The bill would collect about $20 million in fees annually from beauty care companies to help cover the cost of confirming the safety of about five ingredients each year that are suspected of causing problems, such as lead acetate, a color additive in hair dyes, and   a preservative used in certain shampoo and cosmetics. The legislation has won the endorsement of heavyweights including Estée Lauder, whose brands include Clinique, Origins, MAC, La Mer, and Bobbi Brown Johnson  Johnson, maker of Neutrogena and Aveeno and Procter  Gamble, whose brands include Pantene, Head  Shoulders, Herbal Essences and Olay. Industry officials said they decided to embrace the legislation after becoming increasingly concerned that a decline in consumer confidence could hurt their sales. “The   bill is supported by a vast and diverse group of people and groups who all want the same thing  —   cosmetic regulations that best serve the public health and give consumers confidence in the products and ingredients they choose for their families,” Darrel Jodrey, a top federal lobbyist at Johnson  Johnson, said in a statement. Major national environmental, consumer and health nonprofits, such as the American Cancer Society, the Environmental Working Group and the Good Housekeeping Institute, have also backed the plan. But even before Ms. Feinstein formally introduced her legislation in April 2015, the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, in which   has been a   member for over a decade, moved to defeat it, internal documents obtained by The Times show. During a March 2015 strategy session in the New York law offices of a trade association legal adviser, Locke Lord, industry executives were briefed by their lobbying team, who explained that it had already approached the office of Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with jurisdiction over the F. D. A. Michael Lunceford, a senior vice president at Mary Kay overseeing the company's lobbying and public affairs divisions, had done groundwork through the Direct Selling Association, where he is on the board, to help Mr. Upton's 2012   effort. The organization bought billboard, radio and newspaper ads “to gain the attention of the candidate in order to cultivate a champion for the direct selling industry,” according to an industry newsletter.   hired its own   Washington help: William R. Nordwind, a lawyer and lobbyist who spent a dozen years working as a staff member and campaign aide to Mr. Upton. Mr. Hixson, the   spokesman, said the company had not publicly taken a position on the   bill, although it financially supported the independent cosmetics industry association. Mr. Nordwind's team, from the Venable lobbying firm, has contacted Capitol Hill on behalf of the company, Mr. Hixson said. “They have got a bad story out there right now,” Robert Harmala, a former House aide who lobbies for the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, said regarding   and its Wen product line. “They don't want to be the face of the industry for having done this. ” Mary Kay claims credit for persuading Mr. Sessions, whose   district is near its headquarters, to sponsor alternative legislation. Mr. Sessions's proposal still would require beauty care companies to notify the F. D. A. of “serious cosmetic adverse events,” but it would not grant the agency the power to order a recall or collect industry fees to pay for new programs, such as the safety evaluation of cosmetics ingredients. Most important for direct sellers like   Mary Kay and other members of the independent cosmetics group, it would broadly and retroactively   any tougher state laws. “We can't just be out there saying, ‘No, we don't like Feinstein's bill,'” Mr. Harmala said in an interview. Mr. Sessions, after introducing the legislation, became a favorite of the cosmetics industry, campaign finance records show, emerging as the top recipient in Congress of donations from Mary Kay employees, and taking donations from at least 10 other industry executives, including Pam Busiek, the president of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors. Executives at   were not among the donors. More industry donations were sent to Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, and Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, the only other two House lawmakers to help sponsor the bill. Crayton W. Webb, a spokesman for Mary Kay, said the company was committed to helping pass a law that increased the federal government's oversight of the industry, but opposed Ms. Feinstein's bill because “it falls short in providing one clear national and uniform safety standard. ” Ms. Busiek added, “We want something that is not overreaching. ” Mr. Dean declined to comment. The F. D. A. would not comment on the proposals. So far, the agency said, it has found no evidence of contamination or misbranding in Wen products, the only two product flaws it can use to press a company to agree to a voluntary recall. The agency has requested the results of safety tests and other manufacturing data, but it cannot compel the company to release any information. “That's why it is so critical that we get information directly from consumers and their health care providers,” said Susan Mayne, the director of the F. D. A. 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. For consumers dealing with thinning hair, itchy scalps and other problems, the additional responsibility of bringing their case to the government can be a tall order  —   and certainly a confusing one. The government should be helping them, they say. “I think it would be great for the F. D. A. to step in a little bit more,” said Melanie Guitzkow, a    student, who said her hair began to fall out when she used Wen in high school. “Some things, like, shouldn't be on the market because they're damaging. ”",

         "Trey Yingst, chief White House correspondent for the One America News Network, is reporting Monday that three sources of the leaks liberally flowing from President Donald Trump's White House have been found. [SCOOP: Three White House staffers have been identified for leaking classified info. POTUS will fire 'multiple people' when he returns to DC.  —   Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) May 22, 2017,   According to Yingst, three staffers have been identified and referred to the Office of Government Ethics for their role in leaking information from within the White House. Leaks to the mainstream press have constantly plagued the Trump administration in its early days, with opportunely time leaks undermining key administration efforts. Yingst claims his source informed him President Trump will fire “multiple people” on his return to Washington from his landmark foreign tour through the Middle East. It was implied criminal prosecution may also be on the table for those responsible.

         "Using Special Forces Against Terrorism, Trump Seeks to Avoid Big Ground Wars - The New York Times",
         "Eric Schmitt",
         "MARA, Chad  —   From Yemen to Syria to here in Central Africa, the Trump administration is relying on Special Operations forces to intensify its promised fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups as senior officials embrace an   strategy to minimize the American military's footprint overseas. In Africa, President Trump is expected to soon approve a Pentagon proposal to remove constraints on Special Operations airstrikes and raids in parts of Somalia to target suspected militants with the Shabab, an extremist group linked to Al Qaeda. Critics say that the change  —   in one of the few rejections of President Barack Obama's guidelines for the elite forces  —   would bypass rules that seek to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks and commando operations. But in their two months in office, Trump officials have shown few other signs that they want to back away from Mr. Obama's strategy to train, equip and otherwise support indigenous armies and security forces to fight their own wars instead of having to deploy large American forces to   hot spots. “Africans are at war we're not,” said Col. Kelly Smith, 47, a Green Beret commander who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and was a director of a counterterrorism exercise in Chad this month involving about 2, 000 African and Western troops and trainers. “But we have a strategic interest in the success of partners. ” Mr. Trump came to office without a clearly articulated philosophy for using the military to fight terrorist groups. He had promised to be more aggressive in taking on the Islamic State  —   even suggesting during the presidential campaign that he had a secret plan  —   but had also signaled a desire to rein in the notion of the United States as the world's peacekeeper and claimed at various points to have opposed the ground invasion of Iraq. Now, surrounded by generals who have been at the center of a   shift to rely on Special Operations forces to project power without the risks and costs of large ground wars, he is choosing to maintain the same approach but giving the Pentagon more latitude. That leeway carries its own perils. Last week, the Pentagon went to unusual lengths to defend an airstrike in Syria that United States officials said killed dozens of Qaeda operatives at a meeting place  —   and not civilians at a mosque, as activists and local residents maintain. It was yet another example of the mixed success Mr. Trump's forays with special operators have had so far. An   raid in January by the Navy's SEAL Team 6 against Qaeda fighters in Yemen marred the president's first counterterrorism mission, five days after he became commander in chief. In Mosul, however, Special Operations advisers are the American troops closest to the fight in Iraq to oust the Islamic State from its stronghold there. That is also likely to be the case in the impending battle to reclaim Raqqa in eastern Syria. Mr. Trump is largely relying on the policies of his two immediate predecessors, Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush, who were also great advocates of Special Operations forces. On Mr. Obama's orders, SEAL Team 6 commandos killed Osama bin Laden in his   in Pakistan in 2011. But Mr. Trump seems to have taken that appreciation and reliance to another level. He appointed a retired Marine Corps general, Jim Mattis, as defense secretary, and a   Army officer, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, as his national security adviser. Both men have extensive experience with Special Operations forces. And the National Security Council's new senior director for counterterrorism, Christopher P. Costa, is a retired Special Forces intelligence officer. Sharing an unusual window into the private conversations between Mr. Trump and his senior commanders, Army Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of the military's Special Operations Command, said the president had made clear his urgent priority for counterterrorism missions conducted by the military's elite forces during a visit to military headquarters in Tampa, Fla. last month. “There were some pretty pointed questions about what winning looks like, and how are you going to get there,” General Thomas told a Special Operations conference outside Washington after the presidential visit. And while the Pentagon could eventually send a few thousand more conventional troops to the fights in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, General Thomas warned that senior commanders feared that “more troops on the ground may mean you own the problem when you're done with it. ” That concern gives weight to arguments for greater reliance on special operators as the Trump administration for now eschews larger deployments of conventional troops and proposes deep cuts in foreign aid and State Department budgets. The global reach of special operators is widening. During the peak of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 13, 000 Special Operations forces were deployed on missions across the globe, but a large majority were assigned to those two countries. Now, more than half of the 8, 600 elite troops overseas are posted outside the Middle East or South Asia, operating in 97 countries, according to the Special Operations Command. Still, about   of the 6, 000 American troops currently in Iraq and Syria are special operators, many of whom are advising local troops and militias on the front lines. About a quarter of the 8, 400 American troops in Afghanistan are special operators. In Africa, about   of the nearly 6, 000 overall troops are Special Operations forces. The only permanent American installation on the continent is Camp Lemonnier, a sprawling base of 4, 000 United States service members and civilians in Djibouti that serves as a hub for counterterrorism operations and training. The United States Air Force flies surveillance drones from small bases in Niger and Cameroon. Elsewhere in Africa, the roles of special operators are varied, and their ranks are small, typically measured in the low dozens for specific missions. Between 200 and 300 Navy SEALs and other special operators work with African allies to hunt shadowy Shabab terrorists in Somalia. As many as 100 Special Forces soldiers help African troops pursue the notorious leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, Joseph Kony. And Navy SEALs are training Nigerian commandos for action in the   delta. The United States is building a $50 million drone base in Agadez, Niger, that is likely to open sometime next year to monitor Islamic State insurgents in a vast area on the southern flank of the Sahara that stretches from Senegal to Chad. Mr. Trump's tough talk on terrorism has been well received here in Chad, where American Special Operations and military instructors from several Western nations finished an annual   counterterrorism training exercise last week. Many African soldiers and security forces said they would welcome an even larger United States military presence to help combat myriad extremist threats. “Of course we'd like more,” said Hassan Zakari Mahamadou, a police commissioner from Niger. “U. S. forces enhance us. ” The Pentagon has allocated about $250 million over two years to help train the armies and security forces of North, Central and West African countries. But American aid and training alone  —   along with occasional secret unilateral strikes  —   will not be enough to defeat groups like Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and the Islamic State, officials say. “We could knock off all the ISIL and Boko Haram this afternoon,” Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the leader of the military's Africa Command, told the Senate this month, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “But by the end week, so to speak, those ranks would be filled. ” Here on the outskirts of the Chadian capital, N'Djamena, last week, four   boats with mounted machine guns roared down the Chari River. The boats pulled up along the riverbank, just opposite neighboring Cameroon, and disgorged   Chadian Special Antiterrorism Group forces and their American trainers. In a hail of gunfire, shooting blanks, they stormed the thatched huts of a suspected Boko Haram bomb maker seized laptops, cellphones and other material inside for clues on terrorist operations and dashed back to the river, fending off a mock ambush on the way. Piling back into their boats under covering fire, the Chadian commandos sped off in a drill that American and Chadian officers often play out for real in the nearby Lake Chad Basin area. “Extremism is like a cancer,” said Brig. Gen. Zakaria Ngobongue, a senior Chadian officer who has trained in France and at Hurlburt Field, Fla. and was helping oversee the exercise. “We need to continue to fight it. ”",

         "House Appropriations Chair Rodney Frelinghuysen Rebukes Speaker Paul Ryan: Obamacare 2.0 Is 'Currently Unacceptable' - Breitbart",
         "Adelle Nazarian",
         "WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   In a stunning rebuke to House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( ) announced his public opposition to Obamacare 2. 0 on Friday morning. [“Seven years after enactment of Obamacare, I wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue healthcare in America,” Frelinhguysen, who has been lauded as the Garden State's most powerful congressman, wrote in a Facebook post.  Unfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey. In addition to the loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in my   state, the denial of essential health benefits in the individual market raise serious coverage and cost issues. I remain hopeful that the American Health Care Act will be further modified. We need to get this right for all Americans. The House Speaker almost never loses the Appropriations Chairman on major pieces of legislation. The fact Frelinghuysen is against the bill calls into question Ryan's ability to lead the conference —  including his own committee chairs —  in the future on other pieces of legislation. It shows just how unpopular this legislation really is   and further demonstrates Ryan's inability to bring together the different factions of the House Republican conference. Many more Republicans are expected to vote against Speaker Ryan's bill, the American Health Care Act —  or “Obamacare 2. 0” or “Obamacare Lite” or “RyanCare” or “ ” —  as it has become known. Other Republicans who are expected to vote against the revised version of the Affordable Healthcare Act include Rep. Mark Amodei ( ) Rep. Tom Budd ( ) Rep. David Brat ( ) Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) and Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ). Now that Ryan has lost Frelinghuysen —  the chairman of a powerful committee that controls government spending —  it is highly unlikely Ryan will be able to deliver the votes on this. That means Ryan is delivering a loss to President Trump, after failing to control his members. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter @AdelleNaz",
