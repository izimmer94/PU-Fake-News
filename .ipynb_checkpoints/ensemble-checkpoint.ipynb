         "Darrell Lucus",
         "House Dem Aide: We Didn't Even See Comey's Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) \nWith apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week-FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton's email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn't hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”-which we now know to be Anthony Weiner's sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn't matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins-at least two years' worth, and possibly an entire term's worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him-resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz' sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn't even know about Comey's letter at the time-and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn't receive Comey's letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn' receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \nSo let's see if we've got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn't even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn't trample on basic standards of fairness, I don't know what does. \nGranted, it's not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz' planned fishing expedition. But that doesn't mean we can't turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

         "Daniel J. Flynn",
         "Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.' What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton's 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November's election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren't I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn't president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.",

         "Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \nBy Lawrence Davidson \nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government's payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out - specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \nA “partnership” is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” \nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want - a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \nThe Believers \nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth - that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \nTherefore, if someone feeds them “snake oil,” they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors - those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview - have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. \nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council - yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, “ We're looking for truth. But we're particularly looking for truth that works. ” Now what might that mean? \nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview - their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not “work.” So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. \nOn the other hand, as long as what you're selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory - the list is almost endless. \nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers - the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class - presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare's determination that “what is past, is prelude.” Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will - no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.",

         "Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month - the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \nThe US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder's return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \nRais' son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” \nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau's data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic - known as a “double-tap” strike - is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

         "A Whale Takes Up Residence in the Hudson River - The New York Times",
         "Katie Rogers",
         "When Dr. Rachel Dubroff and her family chose their apartment at Riverside Boulevard and 63rd Street in Manhattan, they were thrilled by its picturesque views of the Hudson River. But they did not expect to have a   seat to an annual   event. For two years in a row, Dr. Dubroff said on Tuesday, she has spotted a whale swimming outside her living room window. Last year, she didn't quite believe the sighting was real. But she saw a whale again on Saturday  —   and in the same spot again on Sunday  —   and news reports confirmed her hunch: The Hudson River has a resident humpback. “It was general excitement and shock,” Dr. Dubroff, 39, said, “and how thrilling that a whale can be in the Hudson, based on what we see float by sometimes. ” Indeed, the Hudson, as scenic as it is, does not scream “whale habitat. ” But experts say cleanup and conservation efforts have led to cleaner waters and an abundance of fish, amenities that have attracted at least one humpback whale to the river waters off Manhattan this month. There are other humpbacks in waters nearby. According to Jen Goebel, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whales have been spotted near New York. And the Coast Guard said in a statement on Monday that it had fielded reports of a whale sighting in northern New Jersey waters, swimming from Sandy Hook to Raritan Bay. The   whale that Dr. Dubroff saw in the West 60s last weekend is thought to be the same one that has traversed the waterway, traveling to Liberty Island and to the George Washington Bridge, since it was first sighted around Nov. 9, according to the Coast Guard. Paul Sieswerda, the president of Gotham Whale, an organization that tracks marine life around the city, said the whale had been seen by New Yorkers who have captured photos and videos of it feeding and swimming. Mr. Sieswerda said that it was common to see humpbacks in the waters off New York at this time of year, as the whales finish up their feeding season and begin to think about heading south to breed in warmer waters. “The whales found this spot as a feeding ground,” he said. “Rather than go all the way up to Massachusetts and Maine, they've found a good feeding ground right here in New York. ” The Hudson whale, which Mr. Sieswerda nicknamed Gotham, seems to be healthy and has been exhibiting a behavior called lunge feeding, in which a whale swims forward, mouth agape, as it captures thousands of gallons of water. Inside the gulps, Mr. Sieswerda said, are likely sizable amounts of menhaden, a small forager fish that fishermen call bunker  —   a veritable fish buffet. A whale appearing in the Hudson is very rare, Mr. Sieswerda said, which is why he thinks this one is a solo traveler. But the whale still faces significant danger because it is swimming in   waters. “It's in a very busy area of   activity, and it's going up and down the Hudson, inside the harbor where big ships are,” Mr. Sieswerda said. “So far, it seems to be O. K. and, hopefully, can detect the boats. ” The Coast Guard has urged boaters and fishermen to slow down to avoid distressing the humpbacks, which can grow to 60 feet and can weigh around 40 tons. “When you have whales chasing the bunker, and fishermen chasing the stripers that chase the bunker, accidental interactions between whales and vessels can occur,” Jeff Ray, a deputy special agent with NOAA's law enforcement division, said in the Coast Guard's release. Kayakers and boaters should take extra care to steer at least 100 feet clear of any whales in the area, according to Ms. Goebel, the NOAA spokeswoman. Elsewhere, trouble can lurk for whales in shallow waters. About 80 miles from Manhattan, a humpback whale spent a week stuck in Moriches Bay, off the southern coast of Long Island, and over two days stuck in a sand bar in four feet of water. It was euthanized on Wednesday afternoon by a veterinarian with NOAA's Marine Mammal Stranding Network, Ms. Goebel said. She added that NOAA will work with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to remove the whale's body. Chuck Bowman, the president of the Riverhead Foundation, was among those who had helped to monitor the stranded whale while awaiting guidance from NOAA. “The good thing was 30 years ago you'd see maybe one whale off of Long Island a season,” Mr. Bowman said. “Now you see them all the time due to conservation efforts. ” But, he added, “You get a bigger population and you get a greater chance of things like this happening. ”",

         "Bill Maher, Faulted for Booking Milo Yiannopoulos, Takes Credit for His Fall - The New York Times",
         "Dave Itzkoff",
         "If you were disappointed that Bill Maher brought Milo Yiannopoulos onto his HBO show “Real Time” last week, Mr. Maher is not especially bothered. In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher batted back criticism of the booking by arguing that the appearance of Mr. Yiannopoulos actually helped expose the incendiary   personality's views to a wider audience and hasten his sudden downfall. Mr. Yiannopoulos's collapse was set in motion Sunday when a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion resurfaced a 2016 interview in which he endorsed sexual relations with boys as young as 13. Mr. Yiannopoulos  —   known for a history of offensive remarks about Muslims, Jews, transgender people and other groups, and as a ringleader in a notorious incident of online harassment  —   lost a speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference and a book deal with Simon  Schuster, and then said on Tuesday that he was resigning as a senior editor from Breitbart News. Mr. Maher has been dealing for days with the fallout from his booking of  Mr. Yiannopoulos. The journalist Jeremy Scahill, who had been scheduled to appear on the same episode, withdrew from the show. Mr. Maher has defended the booking on   grounds, saying last week that if Mr. Yiannopoulos was indeed a monster, “nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed. ” But following the show, Mr. Maher came under attack for the chummy and conciliatory vibe of his conversation with Mr. Yiannopoulos and for a panel segment, broadcast online, in which his guest made more inflammatory remarks that seemed to go unchallenged. Speaking on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher, who counts himself as a liberal, did not sound particularly chastened by these assessments. He said he knew his interview with Mr. Yiannopoulos would never be satisfactory to some viewers. “No matter what I did,” he said, “it was never going to be enough for that slice of liberalism that would much rather judge a friend than engage an enemy, because it's easier. ” Mr. Maher spoke further about the experience of having Mr. Yiannopoulos on “Real Time” and its aftermath, and why he will continue to seek out provocative conservative guests. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Given all that has transpired since Friday's show, how do you feel now about your decision to have Milo Yiannopoulos as a guest, and how those segments transpired? Well, let's recap. About a week ago, I went on Van Jones's show, and somebody asked me about the booking. I hadn't really gotten into the details of Milo yet. He was just getting on my radar. I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Then we had Milo on, despite the fact that many people said, “Oh, how dare you give a platform to this man. ” What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe, trying to make a buck off of the left's propensity for outrage. And by the end of the weekend, by dinnertime Monday, he's dropped as a speaker at CPAC. Then he's dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You're welcome. You think his appearance on “Real Time” helped lead to his downfall? That's what I was just saying. And by the way, I wasn't trying to get him removed from society. I'm somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away. They were successful that one time, for six months in 23 years, because that's how long it was between the two shows [“Real Time” and “Politically Incorrect,” Mr. Maher's previous talk show, which aired on Comedy Central and ABC]. It just rubs me the wrong way when somebody says, “I don't like what this person is saying  —   he should go away. ” Do you feel that way even about the kinds of things Milo was saying on your show, or in the other platforms he was given? Can he do damage? I suppose he can. To a degree. Not a great degree, I don't think. Could he offend people? Could he even inspire a borderline person to do something violent? I guess so. But nothing is free in life. People seem to want to live in this world where everything is a  . That's not how life works. Could there have been more accountability in your segments with him? For instance, it seemed like he was allowed to grossly understate his role in harassing Leslie Jones on Twitter.  It's not my job to hold him accountable to everything he's ever said or done. I had eight minutes with him, on the show itself. Sorry I don't have time to go over everything everybody else would want to do. We just had time to, sort of, start a discussion of the broad view of who he is. I don't think he frankly knows what he's going to say half the time, or knows what his philosophy is. But to see him as this monster is a little crazy. You know what he is? He's the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream. So how does someone deal with a personality like Milo, who is going much, much further than other guests, saying things that are demonstrably false? The president says 10 things a day that are provably wrong. If I threw everyone off my show who says things that are provably wrong, I'd never book a conservative and probably half the liberals. When he said that transgender people have a “psychiatric disorder,” do you just move on from that? Move on? It dominated the entire [online] segment. The other guests attacked him. When I say, “That's not unreasonable” [to not want to share a bathroom with a transgender person] it's because women have said that to me: “I want to know,” or “I'm not comfortable with someone in the bathroom, even if they, in their minds, have decided they are a woman. ” Doesn't that opinion count at all? But you don't agree that transgender people have a psychiatric disorder.  No, I don't agree with that. But I don't know that much about the situation. If somebody feels like they're a woman, fine, then you're a woman. I'm O. K. with that. If they've studied that, and they say it's not a psychiatric disorder, I'm O. K. with that too. If that's what scientists decided, that it's not any psychological disorder, it's fine with me. I agree. Since the start of your new season, you have had other guests like Tomi Lahren and Piers Morgan  —   not nearly as provocative, but with whom liberal viewers aren't likely to agree. Are you trying to create conflict on your panels, or rile up your audience? I've never tried to push anybody's buttons. I think everybody else in TV  —   everybody else who does political commentary in a comedic way  —   they're all in one box. It's so predictable, what they're going to do, which is, never say anything that would make anything  —   that would make any liberal give the slightest bit of discomfort. I do a show about what's happening that week in the news. Trump is president. I'm glad that we have enough credibility with both sides, that people who are Trump supporters will still do the show. Going back to “Politically Incorrect,” you booked conservatives like Ann Coulter and Kellyanne Conway  —   —   And Laura Ingraham. We had a whole cadre of blond conservatives. There was a fourth woman conservative we used to book in those days, who we kind of discovered  —   her name was Arianna Huffington. Even after your experience with Milo, do you still want to have guests your viewers haven't encountered or might want to avoid? Yes. I like people who push the limits. I like people who are not afraid to take the slings and arrows, because they're going to explore what's on the edge. Now, is this guy over the edge? Yes. I mean, he's a little cuckoo. But I would rather err on that side than on the side where everybody else is.",

         "Travelers Stranded and Protests Swell Over Trump Order - The New York Times",
         "Peter Baker",
         "WASHINGTON  —   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump's party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump's temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president's order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president's team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. “We're not willing to be wrong on this subject,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ” The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” he said in a written statement. “This is not about religion  —   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ” He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama's administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. “We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. “I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,” he said. “My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ” While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. “Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,” he wrote. “We cannot allow this horror to continue!” His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York's attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was “in compliance with judicial orders. ” Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and “they said we'll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,” Mr. Connolly said. “I said that's not acceptable,” he continued. “We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That's where the problem is, and that's where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ” The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to “claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ” The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. “We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,” he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America's traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she “is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ” Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did “not agree with this kind of approach. ” The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump's front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. “Shame,” they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie “Finding Dory. ” “No hate, no fear,” they added later. “Refugees are welcome here. ” Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ” Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump's handling of the issue. “We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,” said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs' donor network. “The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was “poorly implemented” and urged the president to “make appropriate revisions. ” Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. “They are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ”",

         "Hillary Clinton Email: We Must Destroy Syria For Israel",
         "Dikran Arakelian (noreply@blogger.com)",
         "Share on Facebook A leaked Hillary Clinton email has now confirmed that the Obama administration, with Hillary directing policy, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel's geopolitical interests and stability. The new Wikileaks release shows that Clinton, then Secretary of State orchestrated the war in Syria to overthrow the government of President Assad, because it is “best way to help Israel”. Newobserveronline.com reports: The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498 , following the uproar over Clinton's private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012. The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel's interests. “The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying. Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran's “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel. She specifically links Iran's mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran's “atom bomb” program threatens Israel's “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East. If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel's interests. Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed. Iran's nuclear program and Syria's civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself. It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's security. This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.” The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel's leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel's security, it would also ease Israel's understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly. Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted. Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do: In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria. With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's mind. The email proves—as if any more proof was needed—that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to “protect” Israel. It is also a sobering thought to consider that the “refugee” crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. In addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq—all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the “rebels” and stoking the fires of war in Syria. The real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton—whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people—could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all. Clinton's public assertion that, if elected president, she would “ take the relationship with Israel to the next level, ” would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth.

         "Health Groups Denounce G.O.P. Bill as Its Backers Scramble - The New York Times",
         "Abby Goodnough, Robert Pear and Thomas Kaplan",
         "WASHINGTON  —   Influential groups representing hospitals and nurses came out on Wednesday against a Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, joining doctors and the retirees' lobby to warn that it would lead to a rise in the uninsured. In a letter to lawmakers, major hospital groups wrote, “As organizations that take care of every individual who walks through our doors, both due to our mission and our obligations under federal law, we are committed to ensuring health care coverage is available and affordable for all. ” The groups, including the American Hospital Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Catholic Health Association of the United States and the Children's Hospital Association, said they could not support the bill “as currently written. ” The hospitals and the American Nurses Association joined the American Medical Association and AARP, which rejected the bill on Tuesday. House Republicans have been left scrambling to marshal support from businesses and other interests that stand to benefit from lower taxes if the bill passes. Insurers are on the fence, and other powerful forces like pharmaceutical companies remain largely on the sidelines. Squeezed between wary health care providers and angry conservatives who believe that the bill leaves too much of the Affordable Care Act in place, the Republican leadership and President Trump appear to be facing an uphill climb. But the White House appears increasingly confident about the prospects for a health care overhaul to pass in the House. In a meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated the most trouble in the Senate, where moderate and conservative lawmakers are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by holding the kind of   rallies he led during his presidential campaign. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said Republicans were “going through the inevitable growing pains of being an opposition party to becoming a governing party. ” “It's a new system for people,” he added. “But it's all the more reason why we have to do what we said we would do and deliver for the American people, and govern and use our principles. ” The array of groups taking strong positions against the bill is evidence that its potential consequences extend far beyond health insurance coverage, to much of the nation's economy. The opposition is also a powerful reminder of how many past efforts to overhaul the American health care system failed because of resistance by major interest groups. Winning the support of the health care and insurance industries allowed the Obama administration in 2010 to push through the most significant health care legislation since President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Within a few months after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his administration had lined up support from health care providers, insurers, consumers and pharmaceutical makers by offering a grand bargain: The health bill would include a requirement that most Americans have health insurance, providing millions of new customers through the law's often substantial premium subsidies and its option for states to expand Medicaid. In exchange, hospitals would have to accept spending cuts and the health care industry would have to accept new taxes to pay for the legislation. The Obama White House dedicated enormous effort to win pledges of support before Democrats even put out a bill  —   an effort not replicated by the Trump White House or Republican leaders in Congress. But the Affordable Care Act also created an array of taxes that the Republicans now hope to wipe away, helping them win the support of groups like the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform, led by the   activist Grover Norquist. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation issued estimates this week showing how much revenue the government could lose starting in 2018 under the Republican bill, which the party has called the American Health Care Act, as a result of repealing taxes on drug makers (nearly $25 billion over 10 years) insurers (nearly $145 billion) makers of medical devices (nearly $20 billion) and   households (more than $270 billion from taxes on earned income and investment income). “The American Health Care Act repeals the medical device tax, which will result in greater investments in medical cures, lower health care costs and more   manufacturing jobs in communities across the United States,” trumpeted the Medical Device Manufacturers Association. The extent to which these groups mobilize on behalf of the Republican bill may help determine whether it succeeds. For now, the supporters of the House bill seem badly outgunned by opponents. On Wednesday, as two congressional committees took up the Republican    bill, the American Nurses Association and a coalition of hospital groups came out against the proposal. The A. M. A. which has nearly 235, 000 members and calls itself the voice of the medical profession, sent a letter to leaders of the two committees on Tuesday saying it could not support the Republican bill “because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations. ” In particular, the group said it opposed a plan to replace the sliding,   premium tax credits provided under the Affordable Care Act with fixed credits based on age. The current system, it said, “provides the greatest chance that those of the least means are able to purchase coverage. ” America's Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby, released its own lengthy statement on Wednesday. In a letter to the leaders of the House committees that drafted the bill, Marilyn B. Tavenner, the group's chief executive, warned Republican leaders that their plans to change Medicaid financing, among other things, could harm coverage and care. While many insurers have lost money in the Affordable Care Act's private insurance marketplaces, they have generally profited from the expansion of Medicaid, which would effectively be phased out under the Republican plan. “As a core principle, we believe that Medicaid funding should be adequate to meet the health care needs of beneficiaries,” Ms. Tavenner wrote. “Medicaid health plans are at the forefront of providing coverage for and access to behavioral health services and treatment for opioid use disorders, and insufficient funding could jeopardize the progress being made on these important public health fronts. ” A day earlier, AARP  —   the association of   and older Americans that is another crucial supporter of the Affordable Care Act  —   declared its opposition to the bill and even started running an ad against it. In a letter to Congress, the group said the bill would increase health costs for people ages 50 to 64, could lead to cuts in Medicaid coverage of   care and would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones. The hardening resistance complicated the case for the Republicans as they moved their bill forward on Wednesday. “I respect those organizations and their views,” said Representative Larry Bucshon, an Indiana Republican and a heart surgeon who conceded that criticism of the bill from doctors and hospitals could make it more difficult to sell the measure to the public. “Their voice is an important voice in health care. ” But, he noted, those groups supported the health care law in 2010. “Hospitals have done quite well under the Affordable Care Act, but my constituents have not,” he said. “Their premiums are going up. Their deductibles are high. ” Across the rotunda, Republican senators were less enthusiastic. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said she was not certain that a delay in the rollback of Medicaid coverage was “enough for me. ” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, expressed alarm that the bill's tax credits would not account for higher premium costs in insurance markets like hers, a largely rural state with little competition. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he did not want states that took the Medicaid expansion to “get a benefit” that the states that rejected the program did not. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she was unhappy that the bill removed money for Planned Parenthood. There was also a creeping concern about how quickly the bill was moving. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, essentially promised to move the bill to the Senate floor without the hearings and other processes that are normal for such a   piece of legislation. He had promised when Republicans took the majority that they would honor normal Senate processes and traditions. “I think if that's the approach they take,” Mr. Rubio said, “they won't have the votes in the Senate. ”",

         "The Fix Is In: NBC Affiliate Accidentally Posts Election Results A Week Early: Hillary Wins Presidency 42% to Trump's 40%",
         "Mac Slavo",
         "NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting.\nThe page, a screen shot of which has been sourced from internet archive site The Wayback Machine , is posted below and shows totals for the upcoming Presidential race. It announces Hillary Clinton as the winner.\nAs Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results.\nThe original page has since been reset.\n( Click here for full size image ) \n\nThough the results information appears on an FTP server at WorldNow.com, media companies like NBC's WRCB TV utilize the platform, also know as “Frankly,” to power their news content. This can be verified directly a the WRCB web site by scrolling to the very bottom of the page footer which notes that it is, “Powered By Frankly.”\nIn addition to national results, Jim Stone has identified another page at the WorldNow.com FTP server that appears to show the State-By-State Presidential election results. This page is also accessible in archive format at WayBack Machine with a line by line breakdown available at Stone's website.\nOf interest is that the State-By-State results indicate a Hillary Clinton win in states like Texas (42% to 40%), Florida (44% to 40%) and Pennsylvania (44% to 40%) which have all been identified as states Clinton must steal to win the election .\n\nDo these latest election “results” confirm that the fix is in and the vote is rigged?\nIf so, then we are no longer looking at an election where our votes will count, but rather, a selection where the winner is determined by those who count the votes.\nRelated: \nWill Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out \n“Executive Orders for Sale”: Leaked Email Shows Hillary Auctioning Off ‘Laws' To The Highest Bidder \nWatch This Incredible Video And Decide For Yourself: Did Hillary Clinton Cheat At The Last Debate By Using An Embedded Tablet Device In Her Podium? \nAre you ready for the disaster that will follow this election?

         "Water Protectors Begin Hunger Strike In Support of Standing Rock",
         "Lance Schuttler",
         "Water Protectors Begin Hunger Strike In Support of Standing Rock Nov 23, 2016 1 0 \n“Either we die or this pipeline dies” is the message being sent from three water protectors in Iowa who are calling on the Iowa Utilities Board to shut down the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline that is running through Iowa. \nThe group of three began fasting on Monday morning and said they will continue until the Iowa Utilities Board shuts down the pipeline. Ed Fallon gives a speech to oppose the pipeline. \nRuby Montoya, who is the group's spokesperson, said that more people are expected to join the hunger strike and that will will go on until “they starve to death or until the IUB does their job.” \nShe added that this is “a desperate act for a dire time.” \nThe group continues to maintain that the IUB failed to protect Iowa farmland and that the consequences of when, not if, the pipeline breaks will be catastrophic. \nOne of the hunger strikers, Jessica Reznicek, said: \n“When the pipeline breaks, the whole state of Iowa will be fasting. It's time the Iowa Utilities Board do the right thing and shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline.” George McCloskey meditates with other water protectors. \nHunger strikes have been long known as peaceful ways to protest certain actions, as Mahatma Gandhi completed 17 hunger strikes in India's freedom movement throughout his lifetime. This method of protesting was paramount to Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence. \n\nAs many know, the protection of water at Standing Rock is intensifying though more help is soon to arrive with the announcement that former military veterans are organizing a movement from December 4th-7th to create an unarmed militia at Standing Rock to “defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of militarized police force and DAPL security.” Veterans from the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard will be present, as well as Representative Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, who is also a military veteran. The group has a Facebook page called Veterans Stand for Standing Rock and is encouraged to be shared with fellow veterans who want to go or who might be interested in going. So far, there is about 700 veterans confirmed to be in attendance. \nAdditionally, hacktivists have joined in on the movement as Anonymous has taken down the company's website who is selling tear gas canisters, concussion grenades and other weapons to the militarized police forces. \nVeteran Wes Clark Jr. said that this resistance starting December 4th is “the most important event up to this time in human history. We're not going to go out there and get in a fight with anyone. They can feel free to beat us up, but we're 100% nonviolence.” \nIndeed, that time will be incredibly important and momentous. Will militarized police continue the behavior they've been enacting to former military veterans? How will the police act when they see former veterans dressed in their uniforms marching peacefully? We approach a possible turning point for the ages. While we don't know what will happen during those days just yet, we can put the intention out there that these police drop their weapons and side with the people's voice: which is for this pipeline to not only be stopped, but removed from the Earth. \nThe revolution is happening right before our eyes. \nLance Schuttler graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in Health Science and does health coaching through his website Orgonlight Health .

         "Idiot Who Destroyed Trump Hollywood Star Gets EXACTLY What He Deserves",
         "Robert Rich",
         "Share This \nAlthough the vandal who thought it was “cool” to destroy Donald Trump's Hollywood star looked pretty comfortable making a video from the comfort of his own home, that can't be said for him today. In fact, it seems that the idiot just got exactly what he deserved - and that's not even the real kicker. \nYesterday, Mad World News reported on James Otis, the man who was recorded destroying Trump's star on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California and stealing the two plaques that were in the concrete. Of course, he later stated that the two stolen objects would be auctioned off on election day with the proceeds promised to Trump's so-called “victims.” \nProving to be a cocky moron, Otis gave an itinerary, saying that he wanted to deliver a few remarks at the location of his crime at 9:30 this morning. Unfortunately for him, things didn't go according to plan as the man just got exactly what he deserved. Donald Trump's Hollywood star before (left) and after (right) James Otis destroyed it \nAlthough Otis had promised to turn himself in today, Deadline reports that police tracked him down and arrested him before he could use the incident to further himself any more. Unfortunately for him, the news got even worse when he was officially slapped with a felony vandalism charge. Oh, and that little “auction” he was going to have isn't going to happen since police confiscated at least one of the plaques, which they found stashed in Otis's car: Police confiscated at least one part of the plaque (Source: TMZ ) \nThe real kicker came next, though. Since damages were valued at over $400 , Otis is facing up to 3 years in jail and more than $10,000 in fines. Of course, Otis didn't seem to mind facing the consequences - until, that is, he heard what he'd actually earned. James Otis \nIn fact, he only made himself out to be more of an idiot during an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News when he said, “I was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women.” \nClearly uninformed on the truth, he then added , “It's just a big joke to him. I have children; I have many women in my life who don't think it's a joke. But he does.” He continued, “He lies about it, he shuffles and I don't see, there's no reason to believe at all that it will ever stop now. He'll continue to do this, he'll continue to make women suffer. So that's what I'd tell him. “You need help. Please understand that.” Trump's star is already being repaired (Source: Breitbart ) \nOtis doesn't even understand that what he did wasn't really any big deal. As of right now, the star is being replaced. Furthermore, destroying that property didn't do a darn thing to Trump since it wasn't his property - it was the states. In short, he just cost the American taxpayer more money because now we have to fix it. \nThat's the problem with the entitled mentality these days - it doesn't matter to them who they hurt in the process. Of course, coming off looking like an idiot sure can't feel good, but he'll get a nice long time to think about that while he's rotting in prison for a few years.",

         "Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher, a Mother-Daughter Act for the Ages - The New York Times",
         "Susan Dominus",
         "For anyone who loves the spotlight, mothering can be an ideal role  —   for a while. The mother is a singular star to her baby, whose gaze follows her around the room with the watchfulness of an obsessive fan. For the stars Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, that dynamic seemed to linger well into Ms. Fisher's childhood: Ms. Fisher was the reverent observer, her mother the adored and observed. “When my mother was at home on weekends, we stayed with her as much as possible, which frequently meant we were very involved in watching our mother,” wrote Ms. Fisher in her memoir “Wishful Drinking,” including her brother, Todd Fisher, in her recollections. Sometimes, they watched her sleep often, they watched their mother transform into someone “not of this world,” a trick carried off with makeup and glitter and silk. “When our mother dressed,” Ms. Fisher wrote, “the man behind the curtain became the great and powerful Oz. ” Over the years, Ms. Reynolds and Ms. Fisher had a relationship as conflicted and layered as any other   story in show business, but with an ending that they might think implausible, or even sentimental, had they read it in a script. First Ms. Fisher died on Tuesday, of heart attack at 60 a day later, her mother, 84, succumbed to heart failure of her own, although technically she was likely felled by a stroke. There is something about celebrity   acts like the one lived by Ms. Fisher and Ms. Reynolds that capture the imagination in a way that famous   simply do not. Think of Kris Jenner and the Kardashian sisters, Joan and Melissa Rivers, Judy and Liza. Even the most narcissistic of   mothers seem to have enough psychic energy to love a child passionately, or at least to include the daughter, a younger version of herself, in the realm of things emotionally essential. As glitzy or extreme as their lives are, those   represent, in the push and pull of their relationship, something familiar to so many other mothers and daughters, something they recognize in their own lives: the   in the role of caregiver, the pleasure and suffocation that comes with being worried over. Whose turn is it to watch? Whose turn is it to be watched? Ms. Fisher characterizes her memoir as just one more “pathetic bid” for the attention she did not receive as a young child. Ms. Fisher, it turns out, has plenty of distracting sparkle of her own: With humor, her writing tap dances around her relationship with her mother, whom she describes (twice) as “eccentric” and whose troubled marriages Ms. Fisher mines for comic material. She and her mother were both clever,    victims of those laughably imperfect men. But the public's impression of the   pair was probably more fully formed, fairly or not, by the film “Postcards from the Edge,” the script of which Ms. Fisher adapted from her autobiographical novel of the same name. The daughter in that film, played by Meryl Streep, clearly resents her     mother, who infantilizes but also cares fiercely for her while she is in recovery. In one complicated scene, the mother, played by Shirley MacLaine, steals the show at a party supposedly thrown in her daughter's honor. We see a momentary flash of loathing on her daughter's face, which gives way  —   quickly  —   to admiration, even pure joy, in the song her mother performs for the crowd. She is her mother's biggest fan, as only a child can be. When they are offstage, she is also her toughest critic, as only a child can be. Ms. Reynolds and Ms. Fisher took their   show on the road, performing together in nightclub acts from the time Ms. Fisher was very young, and then performing again, in some version, on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” in 2011. In a lengthy interview, they spoke of their trials, including a   period in which Ms. Reynolds claimed, dramatically, that they did not speak. “We talked, really badly,” Ms. Fisher clarified. She explained that at the time, she needed to separate  —   “to forge some kind of character out of   …     nothing,” she said, her famous wit momentarily leaving her. In “Postcards from the Edge,” the   actress is still asking her mother: “Why do you have to completely overshadow me?” But on Oprah, and also in her own life, Ms. Fisher more than held her own, playing a tough,   princess in “Star Wars”: She, too, was an icon of her time, and she, too, was not quite of this world. If her mother was forever an ingénue, albeit one who could land a wicked zinger, Ms. Fisher was a blazing comic, a teller of truths with little patience for costume and  . From what she called “nothing,” she forged something big and bold and every bit as brilliant as the woman who raised her, less glittering, more glaring. Mothers and daughters who watched them on Oprah saw a mutuality in their regard for one another, and reconciliation in their rapport. There was humor and acceptance  —   not so much a   ending as a loving truce, bound by devotion. For the entirety of her childhood, Ms. Fisher had to endure the public's fascination with her mother, an experience she felt most keenly when they went out in public. “I did not like sharing her,” Ms. Fisher wrote in “Wishful Drinking. ” But toward the end of her mother's life  —   Ms. Fisher did not know it was toward the end of her own life, as well  —   she wanted to show the world the person whom she saw, the mother and human, the Oz behind the curtain whom she loved. That was one reason, Ms. Fisher said, that she consented to having a documentary made about them both, called “Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,” which will be broadcast on HBO on Jan. 7. At times, one of the documentary's directors, Fisher Stevens, was frustrated by just how hard it was to capture the real Ms. Reynolds  —   sometimes, he told The Washington Post, she asked for her lines, and seemed incapable of dropping a performer's pretense in front of the camera one interview concludes with her throwing a kiss, as if she were ending a telethon. Ms. Reynolds, offstage, was a gift she reserved for her daughter and family alone. On the Oprah special, Ms. Reynolds said of her daughter, “I always feel, as a mother does, that I protect her. Who will do that when I'm gone?” she asked. And yet at the end, it was the daughter who protected the mother, hovering over her, in the documentary, when Ms. Reynolds insists on performing despite obvious frailty. Ms. Fisher brings her mother meals, begs her to rest, agonizes over logistics so Ms. Reynolds could comfortably accept a lifetime achievement award she was receiving from the Screen Actors Guild in 2015. When her was daughter was unexpectedly gone, on Tuesday, Debbie Reynolds perhaps felt, at some level, that the show that mattered most was over. When she exited the stage a day later, it was her last and most exquisite bit of showmanship  —   a performance surely of love.",

         "Editor",
         "Strange lights were spotted flying through the night sky in Arizona on Tuesday, leading some to take to social media declaring that they had just witnessed a UFO.\nWitnesses described seeing three to four lights appear and begin traveling from north to south, and many called local station KTVK to report what they saw. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, however, stated that they did not receive any calls about the lights.\nDID ANYBODY ELSE JUST SEE A UFO!?\n— Todd (@tater_todd55) October 26, 2016 \n\nResidents who called another local station reported seeing lights above Glendale, Gilbert, Queen Creek and other East Valley cities.\n@tater_todd55 y'all think I'm playing!! We were at QC wash. pic.twitter.com/4dX6NzHpB1 \n— Todd (@tater_todd55) October 26, 2016 \n\nThe National Weather Service did not report any calls regarding the matter, but based on videos provided to them by ABC15 they stated that the lights appeared to be “very far away and flying at a high altitude.”\nNearby Luke Air Force Base stated that they did not have any aircraft flying after 5:30 PM, and that they were not the source. Witnesses tweeted videos at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who stated that “it is not known what may have caused them to occur.” In June, a massive asteroid zoomed over Arizona skies, and entered the Earth's atmosphere east of the Arizona town of Payson.\n\n“There are no reports of any damage or injuries — just a lot of light and few sonic booms,” Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center said in a statement at the time. “If Doppler radar is any indication, there are almost certainly meteorites scattered on the ground north of Tucson.”\nThat meteor was estimated to be approximately 10 feet in diameter and travelling at roughly 42,000 mph.\nSource: Sputnik News \n",

         null,
         "Follow on Facebook Subscribe by Email Print This Post \nThe legalization of marijuana, in some form, was a ballot initiative in nine states, on Nov. 8, 2016. Five of the nine states voted for recreational use and the other four were focused on medicinal purposes. \nCalifornia, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts passed the recreational use of cannabis. These states join the ranks with Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and D.C. Arizona still offers legal medical marijuana but recreational use was voted down by 51.9 percent. \nFlorida, North Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas voted to join the 24 other states that have legalized the use of the plant. New Recreational Marijuana States and Laws: Massachusetts: Recreational use, sale, possession, and cultivation of cannabis have been legalized. The law faced opposition from both sides of the isle. Republican Governor Charlie Baker and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh joined Attorney General Maura Healey, in March, for a Boston Globe op-ed. The state had decriminalized the use of weed for recreational use. It was also legalized for medicinal use, in 2012. Healey, Baker, and Walsh met to discuss this matter and agreed that the plant should not be easily accessible or sold commercially. The voters in Massachusetts were divided. The recreational use of marijuana was supported by 54 percent. The new law will go into effect December 15. Cannabis sales will follow the same requirements as alcohol. California: Proposition 64 was viewed as the most important among the legalization issues on the ballot. Fifty-six percent of the voters agreed with the initiative, for people 21 and over. This not only completes recreational use of the plant on the West Coast, it benefits the state with the sixth-largest world economy. Cannabis legalization passed despite opposition from Senator Dianne Feinstein and Governor Jerry Brown. In 2014, Brown said: \nHow many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation? \nThe win of Proposition 64, does not simply allow for the commercial sale of marijuana, it rolled back the period of incarceration for thousands of people convicted on marijuana-related charges. The proposition went into effect at 12:01 a.m., on November 9. Residents can grow as many as six plants in their homes. However, it will not be available is stores until Jan. 1, 2018. Driving under the influence of and smoking marijuana in public will remain illegal. Those who break this law will be charged a $100 fine. Nevada: Recreational use, cultivation, possession, and commercial sales of the plant passed with 54 percent. The law pertains to adults, 21 and over. Most of the state is conservative, and until residents helped elect Obama, in 2008 and 2012, it was considered a Red state. However, the legalization of cannabis was opposed by Democratic Senator Harry Reid and Republican Governor Brian Sandoval. Regardless, on Jan. 1, 2018, medical marijuana dispensaries will be able to apply for a license that will allow them to sell the plant products to anyone, 21 or older. Only the dispensaries will be eligible to sell cannabis. Maine: It is legal for adults, 21 and over, to use cannabis for recreational use. People can cultivate, possess, and purchase marijuana. The legislation barely passed with 50.3 percent. The state will add a 10 percent sales tax on recreational cannabis. The new law will allow for retail stores and social clubs, as long as they are licensed and permitted in the municipalities where they grow. \nMany states, including D.C., have opted to decriminalize recreational use of marijuana to save money. During an interview, in March, President Obama told Vice News that incarcerating people for marijuana-related charges is expensive. It was his hope, that if enough states decriminalized possession and use, Congress would reschedule the drug. \nLegalization creates a new economy around the sales of marijuana and cannabis-infused lotions, oils, edibles, and related paraphernalia. Tax revenues have significantly increased in the states that have legalized recreational use of the plant. \nTax revenue from marijuana sales in Colorado was $70 million in the last fiscal year. This was twice the amount collected from alcohol sales over the same period. In 2013, cannabis sales were at $1.5 billion. The revenue grew to $2.7 billion, in 2015. Cannabis investment and research firm ArcView Group believes that if all 50 states and D.C. were to completely legalize the plant, it is possible the U.S. will gain $35 billion in revenue, by 2020. What Will Trump Do? \nDespite the economic boost the legalization of marijuana can bring to the U.S., there is a doubt that President-elect Donald Trump will be supportive. Leslie Bocskor, the president and founder of Electrum Partners, called the future leader of the U.S., “a boogie man of unparalleled size and fearsomeness to the legal cannabis industry.” His election could prevent the recall of the Controlled Substances Act, that Obama and many Americans wanted. \nThe marijuana wins gained in the 2016 election means that now, 60 million Americans will not be arrested, lose student loans, or their children for using the plant at the state level. It is still against federal law to use or possess cannabis. \nExecutive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Ethan Nadelmann said that he cannot predict what Trump will do concerning marijuana or the Controlled Substances Act. In 1990, Trump was for the legalization of all drugs, regardless, he leaned heavily on the Republican drug-war rhetoric in political debates. \nNevertheless, Trump told the International Association of Chiefs of Police that marijuana was an issue for individual states to handle. He agreed that Congress should re-write certain laws to be compatible with the state laws. Lobbyists believe that any impact on the use of cannabis will depend on who Trump chooses for members of his Cabinet. \nAt one time, it was possible that Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, would hold the position of U.S. Attorney General. He delayed the limited legalization of medical marijuana, as the governor of New Jersey. Throughout his own run as a Republican candidate for president, Christie spoke of enforcing federal law against cannabis. However, his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal could force Trump to look, instead, at the former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani for U.S. Attorney General. \nGiuliani was also a federal prosecutor. When he was mayor, more people were arrested (per capita), in New York City, for marijuana-related charges, than any other American city. This makes him another unwanted choice for those who use the plant, in any form, for any reason. Hope for Cannabis in America \nThere is no need for weed-lovers to lose heart, reminds Professor Marsha Cohen, from UC Hastings College of the Law, in San Francisco. She stated that the Department of Justice cannot change things overnight; it would take time, organization, and money for Trump to crackdown on marijuana use nationwide. However, it may not matter who becomes the next attorney general. \nCongress, led by Paul Ryan, has consistently denied funding for the Justice Department to impede on states that legalize cannabis. Despite the desires of the new attorney general, it is likely Congress will continue to prevent federal meddling at the state-level. \nCohen pointed out that Florida voted in favor of the new medical marijuana law and Trump with the same ballot.

         "5 Reasons to Try Acupuncture for Baby Eczema",
         "Rosemary Hansen",
         "Keywords: Acupuncture , baby eczema , cure baby eczema , eczema cure , eczema treatment , heal eczema \nThere was a time when my son's eczema became so severe I was willing to try any natural healing method. My baby was 5 months old when he developed eczema. We tried the usual dose of steroids and over-the-counter creams from our family doctor. It got so bad that his scars were not healing. He wasn't sleeping. And I wasn't sleeping. As a child, my mother took me to an Acupuncturist for migraines. And the migraines stopped after a handful of visits. I remember it being a pretty relaxing experience with the smell of incense and herbs and the quietness of the room. So, I took a leap of faith and booked us for an appointment with a Traditional Chinese Doctor who specialized in skin disorders, allergies, and asthma. Why Try Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine? Reason 1: Acupuncture has been practiced for almost 4000 years in China. \nWith that much history, it's worth a try. It is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patient's body at precise points along the 12 meridians in the body. Meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body. The World Health Organization lists 300 ailments that are treatable by Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture. Reason 2: Acupuncture has helped children with eczema \nIn a study of 37 children who were treated with Chinese Medicinal herbs, the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by 90% in 18 of the children (see Sources). Although it was a small study size, the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks. When my son was a baby, even a 10% improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us. Reason 3: Acupuncture does not hurt babies \nMany people worry about the needles hurting. But the needles that Acupuncturists use are about 1/100 th of a syringe needle. My son was a baby when we started the treatments, and he never cried out when getting the needles in him. Reason 4: Acupuncture relieved my baby's eczema by 80% \nAcupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers. Our doctor stabilized the eczema. Best of all, flare-ups only occurred when my baby was teething. His skin was softer than it had been in months. Acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of 3 months in order to see an improvement. This is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response, which is a long process. But sometimes babies will respond quicker than that. We used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor, and applied it to his skin. This topical mix had a similar effect as hydro-cortisone cream if I applied it 3-5 times per day with a cotton ball. Reason 5: Acupuncture is affordable \nThis is true especially if you go to a student clinic. You can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors. For child and baby treatments, it is even more affordable. It cost us about $15-$30 per visit on average (we tried a few different clinics). Some health plans will cover Acupuncture, so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it. To keep it affordable, I suggest trying to find a specialist in Acupuncture & TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments. Tips for Helping Your Child While Getting Acupuncture \nBring a favorite stuffed animal, a book, or some toys. Try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture. A baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out. Adults typically have needles in for 45+ minutes for each treatment, because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies' bodies do. Check out my YouTube video for more tips! Find an Experienced & Accredited Acupuncturist \nMake sure to look for an Accredited Acupuncturist or TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) Doctor. Be sure the Acupuncturist has some experience in your condition. Chat with the people in the waiting room. And see if they've had success with your doctor. I met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the Chinese Doctor we were going to see. That made me feel more comfortable. \nFind a TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) Doctor who offers Certified Organic Chinese herbs. “Certified Organic” means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides. As well, there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in Chinese herbs. Herbs are just as powerful as prescription medications and can have adverse effects if used improperly. Make sure to ask about the testing done on the herbs that you or your baby are prescribed. Every Condition Has Different Treatment Needs \nCheck with your family doctor to be sure you don't have any conditions that would prevent you from using Acupuncture or Chinese Medicine.

         "Islamic State Supporting Former National Guardsman Pleads Guilty to Terrorism Charge in Virginia",
         "Jenna Leigh Richardson",
         "Former National Guardsman turned Islamic State sympathizer Mohamed Jalloh of Sterling, Virginia pled to guilty in federal court Thursday to a terrorism charge related to a July arrested during an FBI sting operation.\nJalloh, a 27 year old naturalized citizen from Sierra Leone was arrested on July 3rd as part of an FBI counterterrorism operation in which he had communicated to a federal informant that he was interested in participating in a “Fort Hood ” style attack.\nJalloh was apprehended by federal agents after purchasing a Stag Arms rifle at a Virginia arms dealer that had been rendered inoperable as part of the operation.\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's office , authorities discovered during their operation that Jalloh was attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State by “assisting in the procurement of weapons” to be used in an attack on U.S. soil.\nFollowing his arrest, Jalloh admitted to traveling to Africa to join the Islamic State, adding that he had quit the National Guard after listening to online lectures from deceased al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Aulaqi.\nVia Justice.Gov \n…in March 2016, a now-deceased member of ISIL brokered an introduction between Jalloh, 26, of Sterling, Virginia, and an individual in the United States who actually was an FBI confidential human source (CHS). The ISIL member was actively plotting an attack in the United States and believed the attack would be carried out with the assistance of Jalloh and the CHS.\n…Jalloh stated that he recently had taken a six-month trip to Africa, where he had met with ISIL members in Nigeria and first began communicating online with the ISIL member who later brokered his introduction to the CHS.\nDuring their meeting, Jalloh also told the CHS that he often thought about conducting an attack and that he knew how to shoot guns. Jalloh praised the gunman who killed five U.S. military members in a terrorist attack in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 2015, and stated that he had been thinking about conducting an attack similar to the November 2009 attack at Ft. Hood, Texas.\nDuring the May 2016 meeting, Jalloh asked the CHS about the timeline for an operation and commented that it was better to plan an operation for the month of Ramadan.

         "Former Vatican Spox Denies Rumors That Pope Benedict XVI Resigned Under Duress",
         "Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",
         "The former papal spokesman has denied rumors that Pope Benedict XVI resigned under “tremendous pressures,” including from the Obama administration, asserting rather that he did so under his own volition. [In response to recent statements by Italian Archbishop Luigi Negri that suggested Benedict had resigned under significant duress, Father Federico Lombardi (pictured) said Thursday that the Pope Emeritus must be taken at his word when he said he had stepped down “in full freedom and responsibility. ”  “There is no mystery to be revealed,” Lombardi said. “Benedict XVI is a man who put the truth first. How can someone so blatantly contradict what he said and then solemnly reaffirmed?” In statements earlier this week, Archbishop Negri claimed that the Obama administration may have been complicit in the “tremendous pressures” that led the former pope to resign in 2013. It is “no coincidence” that some Catholic groups “have asked President Trump to open a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the administration of Barack Obama exerted pressure on Benedict,” Negri said in an interview Monday, citing revelations by Wikileaks regarding efforts by the Democratic Party to influence the Catholic Church in the United States. Father Lombardi, who was papal spokesman during the Benedict years, noted that the former pontiff offered a substantially different account of his resignation from the one offered by Negri, and he did so “publicly before the cardinals gathered in Consistory and the world” and again in an interview book with Peter Seewald titled Last Testament. According to Father Lombardi, Negri's comments have provoked questions and “unnecessary confusion. ” Negri, who claims to be Benedict's “friend,” offers an odd demonstration of friendship in “triumphantly” contradicting what his friend has said, Lombardi observes. “I do not think it is necessary to think of terrible pressures from overseas,” Lombardi states. “We can easily think that his was a very wise and sensible decision, before God and before men. ” “I believe that several of his successors will be grateful,” he said.

         "Aider les migrants et aller en prison? La vie en Europe est complexe…",
         null,
         "6 329 2 5 Les volontaires qui aident les réfugiés en Europe, sont-ils vraiment des complices de terroristes? Depuis le début de la crise migratoire, les Européens se posent de nouvelles questions en matière de sécurité. Ces craintes sont parfois poussées jusqu'à l'absurde. Une bénévole hongroise risque même une peine de prison. \nL'arrivée massive des migrants a divisé les Européens dont certains craignent, et non sans raison, la montée du terrorisme. Mais ces craintes sont parfois poussées jusqu'à l'absurde. Une volontaire de Budapest, Adele Nagy, 38 ans, risque d'être condamnée à 20 ans de prison pour avoir aidé les réfugiés. « J'ai collecté des vêtements, des produits alimentaires, des médicaments et des produits d'hygiène pour femmes. Mes amis m'ont trahie, ils croyaient que j'aidais les terroristes et m'ont dénoncé aux autorités. En Hongrie, je risque d'écoper de vingt ans de prison. Je suis donc partie pour les Emirats arabes unis », a indiqué Adele Nagy cité par la chaîne de télévision RT. © AP Photo/ Muhammed Muheisen Les réfugiés afghans «déçus» par la vie en Europe Selon Adele Nagy, le gouvernement hongrois considère les réfugiés comme des terroristes potentiels et les médias en persuadent les habitants locaux. Plusieurs Hongrois ont déjàété condamnés à des amendes et même à des peines de prison pour leur bontéà l'égard des migrants. « La plupart des Hongrois détestent les musulmans uniquement en raison des fausses informations qu'on diffuse. Mais je crois que nous devons aider les réfugiés parce qu'ils se trouvent dans une situation difficile, leur pays natal est en proie à une guerre », a ajouté Mme Nagy. \nLes Européens qui sympathisent avec les migrants reconnaissent qu'il peut y avoir des criminels parmi les réfugiés, mais ils sont plutôt confiants, d'après la mère d'une étudiante de Berlin, Jana Olernikova. « Ma fille (…) donne des cours d'allemand aux enfants des réfugiés syriens et afghans à Vienne et à Bratislava. Elle a beaucoup d'amis parmi les migrants (…). Je ne dirais pas que je crains de me promener dans les rues depuis le début de la crise. Il peut sans doute y avoir des criminels parmi les migrants, mais il y en a aussi parmi les Européens. Je suis contente que je puisse voir la vie arabe, j'aime la diversité culturelle en Europe », a indiqué Jana Olernikova. © AFP 2016 PHILIPPE HUGUEN Calais: «Les réfugiés ont le droit d'avoir une vie heureuse» Selon Miriam Dusterhoft, bénévole au camp de réfugiés de l'association humanitaire ASB en Allemagne, l'arrivée des migrants est une nouvelle occasion pour les Européens de faire preuve de souplesse. « Je porte une jupe longue ou un pantalon. Je couvre mes bras. Mais c'est une décision personnelle, j'ai beaucoup de tatouages et je ne veux pas gêner les gens qui n'y sont pas habitués. Je ne crois pas que mes droits soient lésés, je porte ce que je veux en ville », a précisé la volontaire. \nSelon l'agence Frontex, plus de 1,8 million de migrants sont arrivés en Europe en 2015. Ce flux de réfugiés a compliqué la vie des habitants locaux. Les problèmes causés par la présence d'un grand nombre de migrants font réagir les autorités. En France, le démantèlement du camp des réfugiés de Lande, aussi baptisé la Jungle, a commencé le 24 octobre. Les migrants seront relogés dans des centres d'accueil en France ou transférés vers d'autres pays européens. \nSuivez Sputnik sur Telegram pour ne jamais manquer les actualités les plus importantes grâce à nos sélections du matin et du soir.

         null,
         "Thursday 27 October 2016 by Davywavy Destruction of Walk Of Fame star leaves Donald Trump down to his last six Horcruxes \nStabbing a copy of The Art Of The Deal with a Basilisk's tooth is the next step to eliminating Donald Trump, according to experts this morning. \nDonald Trump howled in agony and demanded a flask of serpent's milk to help him recover some strength after the destruction of his first Horcrux on Hollywood's Walk of Fame yesterday. \nTrump, whose unusually-styled hair is believed to hide a face on the back of his head, is understood to have concealed fragments of his soul in multiple receptacles in an attempt to protect himself from defeat in the forthcoming election. \nFragments are believed to be hidden in places as diverse as the fabric of Trump Tower, a pussy he grabbed without warning in 2003, and Mike Pence's unnaturally shining white head of hair. \nThe last Horcrux is believed to be the one national poll which has shown him in the lead.

         "Clinton Campaign Demands Intelligence on Possible Russian Efforts to Elect Trump - The New York Times",
         "Jennifer Steinhauer, Jeremy W. Peters and Amy Chozick",
         "■   Donald J. Trump is postponing until January his announcement about how he will handle his private business interests. ■ The Clinton campaign breaks its silence and demands declassification of the intelligence on Russian election meddling. ■ Mr. Trump takes to Twitter to deny Russian involvement in his victory. ■ Senator John McCain says there is no doubt about Russian hacking, which he called “warfare. ” ■ Carly Fiorina for director of national intelligence? She certainly took the  's line on China. For those waiting to see Mr. Trump hold a news conference to discuss the ethical concerns about conflicts with his business, you'll have to wait a little longer. Transition officials said on Monday evening that they were postponing a news conference scheduled for Thursday at which Mr. Trump had said he would reveal his plans to avoid conflicts of interest with his sprawling real estate business. The   instead will make that announcement in January  —   likely before his inauguration and after an extended vacation at his    resort in Florida  —   officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News. Officials said the focus on building a cabinet had consumed more of Mr. Trump's time than expected. And they said that it was taking time to address how to address the large, iconic real estate holdings that are part of the global Trump business. As the swirl of allegations around Russia's efforts to elect Mr. Trump roils Washington, one voice has been absent: Hillary Clinton's. John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, broke the silence on her behalf, demanding the declassification of all information about Russia's meddling as well as an explanation from the Obama administration of what it knew and when it knew it. “We now know that the C. I. A. has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,” Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. “This should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. ” “This is not a partisan issue, and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia's role,” he continued. “We believe that the administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia's interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia's roles in the election and to make this data available to the public. ” Thrown on the defensive, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that the White House did not announce a major probe of Russia's interference before the election partly because many voters would have seen such an announcement as political meddling. He said Russia did not hack the electoral process or the counting of votes. “But what is also clear is that the results of the hack and leak effort carried out on the orders of Russia were extensively discussed prior to the election,” Mr. Earnest said. With evidence mounting that Russian intelligence promoted his election, the   continued his denial, via Twitter. That second post is a head scratcher. The United States government  formally accused Russia of   trying to sow discord in the democratic process through its hacking in early October. It stopped short of saying the goal was to elect Mr. Trump. And forensic analysis does allow experts to trace the source of a hack. Oh, and fresh off his shot at Boeing over the cost of an Air Force One upgrade, Mr. Trump took a jab at another expensive military program, the   stealth fighter. On that one, he will have bipartisan support  —   just not in congressional districts where the fighter is built. Mr. McCain said on Monday that there was “no doubt about the hacking” by Russian intelligence services into Democratic campaign accounts, which he called “another form of warfare. ” Appearing on “CBS This Morning” with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next minority leader, Mr. McCain said the   investigation of Russian meddling in the election would include his committee as well as the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees. He said a Senate investigation would be necessary despite President Obama having already ordered up an inquiry, as that one would not be completed before the end of the Obama administration. The implication was that the new Trump administration would not follow through. “We don't want to point a finger, and I don't want this to turn into the Benghazi investigation,” Mr. Schumer added, referring to the House investigation into the attacks on an American compound in Libya, which he said had been partisan. “This is serious stuff. ” One week before the Electoral College meets to ratify Mr. Trump's election victory, 10 electors  —   including a Texas Republican who has turned on Mr. Trump, and Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi  —   have demanded their own intelligence briefing on Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump. Their request: Ms. Fiorina, the former   chief executive, emerged from a meeting with the   at Trump Tower on Monday to talk tough, not on Russia but on China, which she called “our most important adversary and a rising adversary. ” Ms. Fiorina was called in to discuss the job of director of national intelligence, a senior transition official said. And Ms. Fiorina, once a bitter foe of Mr. Trump's, was effusive. “We talked about hacking, whether it's Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking,” she said. “We talked about the opportunity that the   has to literally reset things, to reset the trajectory of this economy, to reset the role of government, to reset America's role in the world and how we're perceived in the world. And I think it's why he's getting such fantastic people in his administration. ” Mr. Trump and Ms. Fiorina clashed bitterly when she ran against him for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump denigrated her appearance last year in an interview with Rolling Stone, saying, “Look at that face!” Ms. Fiorina briefly agreed to be Senator Ted Cruz's   running mate before he, too, was vanquished by the eventual nominee. All appears to be forgiven. “First I want to say, he has really cool stuff in his office,” she said. “All of these athletes have given him all this incredible memorabilia. I was particular taken by Shaq O'Neal's shoe, which is huge. I guess it takes a champion to know a champion. ” Three days ago, an image calling for the extermination of Muslims was posted on former Representative Allen West's Facebook page. The outrage prompted an aide to Mr. West, a former Army lieutenant colonel, to claim credit and take the image down. The outrage wasn't too great to deny Mr. West another audience with the   on Monday at Trump Tower. Nor was it enough to prompt a question from the reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, though they did ask Mr. West about Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump president. Reporters: Should there be a bipartisan investigation of Russia hacking? Mr. West: “I think there are more important things. We're about to see a collapse in Syria, Iraq is falling apart. the Iran nuclear deal is horrific. China and Russia are expanding. I think that's where we need to focus your intelligence efforts. ” The Trump transition team officially named Gary D. Cohn, the longtime president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, to be the director of the White House National Economic Council. After a campaign full of attacks on Wall Street  —   and Goldman Sachs in particular  —   Mr. Trump will have Goldman's No. 2 in the West Wing and a former Goldman partner, Steven Mnuchin, next door at Treasury, if he is confirmed. But the transition team tried to find something inspirational in the latest multimillionaire: That is one of the rare moments where Shaker Heights, an affluent suburb of Cleveland, is mined for inspirational struggle. Mr. Trump is looking at appointing a rising Republican star from South Dakota, Representative Kristi Noem, as his secretary of agriculture, a senior official working on the transition said Monday. The transition team is vetting Ms. Noem now, and she is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump this week. Ms. Noem, 45, would be one of the younger members of Mr. Trump's cabinet  —   a group that so far consists mostly of older men. She has been planning to leave Congress at the end of her next term in 2018 to run for governor of South Dakota. Another name floated for the agriculture job, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is being considered for a variety of jobs, including energy secretary. Because she is a Democrat  —   and would likely be replaced in the Senate by a Republican  —   the transition official said she could essentially have “whatever job she wants. ” Speaking of roles, the former Texas governor, Rick Perry, who wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy but could not remember its name on live television, has emerged as a leading candidate for energy secretary. Although Texas is rich in energy and Mr. Perry is big on extracting it, he cannot afford too many “oops moments” if he is named to that post. The Energy Department's primary role is to design nuclear weapons and ensure the safety and reliability of the nation's aging nuclear arsenal  —   through a constellation of scientific laboratories. The two men who served as President Obama's energy secretaries were scientists, one with a Nobel Prize, the other from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Trump is also looking at two other possibilities for energy secretary. He likes Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  —   both Democrats  —   for the job. Both are under tremendous pressure from fellow Democrats not to accept a cabinet job.",

         "Dem Rep Moulton Warns of Possible Nuclear War With Russia - Breitbart",
         "Jeff Poor",
         ".@sethmoulton warns of ”nuclear war”   Russia, says Trump team should take threat seriously https:  . :  .  Friday on CNN's “New Day,” Rep. Seth Moulton ( ) a member of the House Armed Services Committee, doubled down on remarks he had made earlier in the week in Austin, TX at the South by Southwest music festival regarding the possibility of a U. S. nuclear war with Russia.  Moulton argued Russia had violated the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and criticized President Donald Trump for not acting more forcefully against Russia for the violation. That he said raised the possibility of nuclear war with Russia should Russia use nuclear weapons against U. S. allies in Europe. “Russia has not only violated this treaty, they have also changed their doctrine,” Moulton said. “For a long time, Russia and the United States had this sort of mutual agreement, mutually assured destruction, that if they shot their weapons at us, we'd shoot our weapons at them and therefore a nuclear war was unlikely to happen. But what Russia now says is that they will quote, ‘escalate to deescalate.' They are willing to use nuclear weapons to deescalate a conventional attack. ” “And I think that the problem here is that we don't really have a plan to deal with that,” he continued. “If Russia starts using nukes against our allies in Europe, we may well use nukes in retaliation. What if they target American troops  —   like the American troops who are training right now in Poland  —   with a nuclear attack? What are we going to do and how quickly can that get out of control? That is why this is such a serious threat and why the Trump administration has got to take this more seriously. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

         "Donald Trump's Slip in Polls Has G.O.P. Worried About Congress - The New York Times",
         "Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns",
         "Donald J. Trump's support has plunged across the   map over the last 10 days, wiping out his political recovery from September and threatening to undo weeks of Republican gains in the battle for control of Congress. For his party, Mr. Trump's reversal in fortune comes at the worst possible moment: Having muted their criticism of Mr. Trump in hopes that he could at least run competitively through Election Day, Republicans must decide in the next few days, rather than weeks, whether to seek distance from his wobbly campaign. Should Mr. Trump falter badly in his second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Republican congressional candidates may take it as a cue to flee openly from their nominee, said two senior Republicans involved at high levels of the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private party strategy. Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina  —   three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential. Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist involved in several House races in swing states, said she was dismayed by a sudden exodus of independent voters in more diverse parts of the country. “They are really starting to pull away from Trump,” said Ms. Hickey, describing his soaring unpopularity with independents as entering “uncharted territory. ” Mr. Trump's erratic behavior last week after his poor performance in the first debate with Mrs. Clinton  —   attacking a former beauty pageant winner over her weight, and making an issue of the Clintons' marriage  —   has alarmed a number of Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell expressed concern that Mr. Trump might not have bottomed out yet and could lose even more support among women, according to a Republican official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private conversation. If the   dip in Mr. Trump's standing has heightened anxieties among Republican officials and political operatives, a steady if unspectacular performance by his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, in the   debate on Tuesday failed to quiet their nerves. “Two weeks ago I would have said Republicans would hold control of the Senate, but there's just so many seats up and nobody is getting separation,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, referring to the number of the party's candidates still locked in tight races. “It worries me that we're this close to Election Day and you're not seeing that separation, because it makes you wonder what kind of impact the top of the ticket has. ” Other Republicans are holding out hope that Mr. Trump can at least execute what some cheekily call a “ ” strategy: holding Mrs. Clinton to a narrow victory, and sparing other Republican candidates in the process. Jay Bergman, a petroleum executive and Republican donor from Illinois, said his fellow contributors were no longer optimistic that Mr. Trump will win, and they have lowered their sights. “They want the guy to make a credible showing,” he said. “They're afraid that if Trump really screws up and looks bad, then   there are going to be a lot more votes for Democrats. ” If Mrs. Clinton wins, putting Tim Kaine, as vice president, there to break a tie, Democrats would need four seats to take control of the Senate. Officials in both parties see Republican incumbents in Wisconsin and Illinois as likely to lose, so Democrats would need just two more pickups to capture the majority if they retain the rest of their seats. Republicans worry that Mr. Trump's difficulties in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, where Republican incumbents are caught between their own base and moderate voters appalled by the party's nominee, could hand Democrats those decisive seats. Senator Kelly Ayotte, the Republican up for   in New Hampshire, demonstrated the vise she is in this week when she said at a debate that Mr. Trump would represent a good role model for children, only to recant a few hours later. Sensing new opportunity, Democrats intend to redouble their efforts to tie Republican candidates to Mr. Trump in states and districts with large numbers of   voters and minorities. “I think it's quite effective in New Hampshire, in suburban Philadelphia and in Nevada,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat. Compounding their difficulties, Republicans are also fending off a challenge to Senator Richard M. Burr in North Carolina, a state Mrs. Clinton is determined to win, and have also become just as worried about Senator Roy Blunt's prospects in Missouri. Strategists in both parties who have seen internal polling say Mr. Blunt, whose seat initially seemed safe, is now trailing his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, a deft campaigner who has been helped by Mrs. Clinton's narrowing deficit in the state. The good news for Senate Republicans, besides Mrs. Clinton's own unpopularity and Mr. Trump's history of bouncing back from   wounds, is that Democrats may need to pick up more than just two seats to seize the majority. In Nevada, which has the only   Senate seat being aggressively fought over this year, strategists in both parties say Republicans have an advantage in the race to succeed Harry Reid, the minority leader. Some Republicans doubt the party will take the step of completely abandoning Mr. Trump unless a landslide gap opens in the presidential race. In that event, Democrats intend to appeal to Mrs. Clinton to spend more of her time and money in areas where the party's congressional candidates are struggling. In the House, where Republicans enjoy a   majority, the party's strategists still insist that Mr. Trump's effect has been limited while his poll numbers have fallen since the first debate, he is not yet seen as so much of a drag on the ballot that he could send the party's other candidates to defeat. House Democrats, however, finished polling 30 battleground districts last week  —   before the fallout from the first presidential debate  —   and concluded that Mr. Trump remained toxic for Republican congressional candidates. Geoff Garin, one of the Democratic pollsters who conducted the survey, said undecided or wavering voters tended to see Republicans as “putting party loyalty ahead of the country by supporting Trump. ” “Candidates' support for him and unwillingness to stand up to him becomes a black mark,” Mr. Garin said. In a growing list of House races, Democrats are showing ads that link Republican lawmakers directly to Mr. Trump. A commercial in California brands Representative Jeff Denham as “Donald Trump's man in Washington. ” An ad in Orlando, Fla. describes Representative John L. Mica as having “the same harmful views on women” as Mr. Trump. Kelly Ward, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said swing voters tended not to distinguish between lawmakers who vocally endorsed Mr. Trump and those who have stayed silent, neither supporting nor actively opposing his candidacy. “They're trying to live in this mushy middle, and I think that's where voters will hold them accountable,” Ms. Ward said. “The separation Republicans think they will see from Donald Trump is just defied by history. ” A handful of Republicans have explicitly sought distance from Mr. Trump already. Robert J. Dold, a congressman from Illinois who has said he will not vote for Mr. Trump, began running a commercial this week that shows him switching off a television broadcast featuring clips of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. And veteran Republicans have urged Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, who is seeking   in a district Mr. Trump is behind in the polls, to portray himself as a check on Mrs. Clinton, though he has not yet done so. Few have gone even as far as Mr. Dold, fearing backlash from Mr. Trump's ardent supporters  —   and perhaps from Mr. Trump himself, who has repeatedly attacked Republicans who have snubbed him. Indeed, at a   event outside Chicago last month, Mr. Trump noted in a biting aside that Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, a Republican who opposes Mr. Trump, was on track to be defeated, according to Mr. Bergman, who attended the event. If Mr. Trump fails to recover, Republicans still question whether Mrs. Clinton is capable of piling up enough of a victory margin to pull congressional Democrats into office along with her. Mike Shields, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” that supports Republican House candidates, said Democrats were unlikely to win races on Mr. Trump's weakness alone. “We accepted that we had a challenging nominee,” Mr. Shields said. “But in some districts where Trump is either down or has a very low approval rating, they are not able to take advantage of it. ” Mr. Shields added that Democrats have “had to delude themselves that there's only one presidential candidate running. ”",

         "Jakarta Bombing Kills Three Police Officers, Linked to Islamic State",
         "John Hayward",
         "Two suicide bombers attacked a bus station in Jakarta on Wednesday, killing three police officers and wounding at least a dozen people. The Indonesian government believes the Islamic State was responsible. [The attack was carried out in the Kampung Melayu area of Indonesia's capital by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated themselves about five minutes apart, according to Reuters.  The New York Times noted that the large police presence at the bus station was due to a parade, part of Jakarta's festivities leading up to the beginning of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan on Saturday. Another possible factor in the timing of the attack was the formal resignation of Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese heritage who is currently serving a   jail sentence for blasphemy against Islam. Ahok's trial and conviction inflamed both racial and religious tensions. He abandoned his appeal against the blasphemy sentence on Tuesday and resigned his office on Wednesday. In addition to the Ramadan parade, the New York Times noted that “thousands of   Muslims” celebrated the governor's resignation on the streets in the hours leading up to the suicide bomb attack. Another theory, advanced on Indonesian television by National Police spokesman Awi Setyono, is that Indonesian extremists might have been “triggered” by the ongoing clash between ISIS forces and the government of the Philippines, and by the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. “These victims are known to us. They are police. They are bus drivers. They are motorcycle taxi drivers and grocers. I have ordered the police to hunt the terrorists and get to the root of this attack,” declared Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Widodo advised citizens to “keep calm and keep cool” because “we Muslims are preparing to enter the month of Ramadan for fasting. ” He ordered police to “thoroughly investigate the networks of the perpetrators and hunt them to the roots. ” Although no group has made a formal claim of responsibility, ISIS involvement is suspected by both Indonesian officials and analysts. “The Islamic State remains the main driver of attacks in Indonesia, and the threat posed by militants linked to the group is likely to escalate in the country,” Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center analyst Otso Iho told CNN. Iho noted that “experienced militants” who fought for ISIS in Iraq and Syria are returning to their home countries, increasing the threat level dramatically. Only a few hundred Indonesians are believed to have traveled to the “caliphate” to fight for ISIS, but the terror state's recruiting efforts in the world's largest Muslim nation have been disturbingly effective with potential homegrown operatives. Indonesian police said the weapons appeared to be   bombs carried in backpacks. A police inspector said that “aluminum, nails, buckshot, and receipts for purchasing rice cookers” were found at the scene of the attack. The Associated Press reports that Indonesian   squads raided two houses believed to be owned by the bombers, identified as Ichwanul Nurul Salam, 40, and Ahmad Sukri, 32. Several of their relatives were also taken in for “questioning and DNA tests,” according to the chief of the   squad. Salam's wife reportedly told investigators that the bombs were assembled by another militant known as “Agus,” who is now sought by police and considered “at large and dangerous. ” A similar bomb, also believed to have been designed by Agus, was detonated in February by a member of an Indonesian extremist network called Jemaah Anshorut Daulah that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.",

         "Steven Broiles",
         "Posted on November 3, 2016 by DCG | 6 Comments \nTruth hurts. \nFrom Washington Post : Authorities are investigating apparent tampering with an electronic road sign at a busy Virginia commuter lot that resulted in a disparaging remark about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and a call for people to “Vote Trump.” \nThe sign at the Tackett's Mill commuter lot in Lake Ridge flashed three consecutive message screens: “CROOKED ­HILARY”; followed by a profanity (“IS A B ---- ”); followed by “VOTE TRUMP.” \nThe messages were on display for an unknown period Tuesday evening while commuters headed to their homes in the Virginia suburb, about 25 miles southeast of the District. \nTheir tone reflects the bitter 2016 presidential race, in which both major-party candidates are historically unpopular and Trump's supporters openly wear T-shirts calling Clinton the b-word and gleefully chant “Lock her up” during his rallies. \n“Crooked Hillary” is a name Trump coined for Clinton and uses regularly. Earlier this week, a tweet from the account of Texas's agriculture commissioner , a Trump adviser, took the name-calling a step further, using a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to Clinton. \nIn Prince William County, the offending electronic sign was one that had been placed in the commuter lot about a month ago by the county elections office. It was programmed to broadcast a message encouraging early voting for those who cannot make it to the polls on Tuesday. \nThere are about 10 such signs posted in heavily trafficked areas across Prince William County, a relative Republican stronghold in the Washington area. The Board of County Supervisors is chaired by Corey Stewart (R), a high-profile cheerleader for Trump who co-chaired the GOP nominee's Virginia campaign until a dispute last month led to his ouster . \nElection officials in the county, which also has a fast-growing Latino population, are taking special measures this year to speed voting and minimize potential disruptions at the polls. \nOn Wednesday, officials said the tampered-with sign equipment had not been locked, giving whoever changed the message easy access to a keyboard panel inside. “There's a set of instructions next to the panel,” said Winston Forrest, a spokesman for the county elections office. “Anyone who could get access to it could make the change.” \nAfter the errant message was reported, it was turned off and the equipment was removed, according the county police. \nCounty elections officials said they have placed locks on the remaining voting road signs in the county. “There are no more of these types of messages,” Forrest said. \nRead the rest of the story here . \nDCG",

         "Jeff Sessions on Immigration Law: 'I'm Going to Follow The Laws Passed By Congress' - Breitbart",
         "Julia Hahn",
         "Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions told the Senate Tuesday morning that voters believe immigration policy should prioritize the needs of American workers. [Sessions' remark came when Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin claimed Sessions would not support a “humane” rewrite of the nation's immigration law. “There's not a spot of evidence in your career to suggest that as Attorney General you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner,” Durbin said to Sessions. “Tell me I'm wrong. ”  “Well, you are wrong, Senator Durbin,” Sessions replied, adding: I'm going to follow the laws passed by Congress. As a matter of policy, we disagreed on some of those issues. I do believe that if you continually go through a cycle of amnesty that you undermine the respect for the law and encourage more illegal immigration into America. I believe the American people spoke clearly in this election. I believe they agreed with my basic view. Throughout the 2016 election, the American people rejected multiple candidates who ran on a position of immigration amnesty in favor of a now   Donald Trump, whom Sessions endorsed and who was vocal about his desire to enforce U. S. immigration law. In addition, the American people have considered and rejected various amnesty proposals on multiple occasions, including in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. Ken Palinkas, the former head of the nation's immigration caseworkers —  Citizenship and Immigration Services —  has warned that the DREAM Act proposals to give amnesty to illegal aliens who allegedly came to the U. S. as minors, a policy which has been championed by Durbin, would expand birthright citizenship to include the   (today it is applied to the U. S.  children of illegal immigrants). Palinkas has explained that DREAMer amnesty “extend[s] birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries” and represents a promise of “perpetual amnesty. ” Palinkas has argued that the concept of DREAMers was intended to create a permanent loophole to U. S. borders. In other Western countries all foreign nationals illegally residing in the country are subject to immigration laws. In the United States, however, the   DREAMer population was created in order to effectively carve out a sector of the illegal alien population who are exempt from immigration law. During his Tuesday confirmation hearing, Sessions went on to tell the Committee that the American people are entitled to a lawful system of immigration that advances their best interests. “It's a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for the United States of America that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country, and if they're get accepted, they get in. If they're not accepted, they don't get it. And I believe that's right, and just, and the American people are right to ask for it. We have not delivered that for them,” Sessions said. Sessions' declaration is remarkably similar to prior statements made by civil rights champion and   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who argued in favor of immigration control and explained that, “credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in those who should be kept out, are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave. ” Throughout the hearing, Sessions' emphasized that it is the role of Congress to implement policies supported by the American electorate. “The best thing for us to do,” Sessions said, “[is] let's fix this system and then we can work together after this lawlessness has been ended and then we can ask the American people and enter into a dialogue about how to compassionately treat people who have been here a long time. ” “I had a responsibility as a member of this body to express my view and vote as I believed was correct on dealing with issues of immigration,” Sessions said. “That's not the Attorney General's role. The Attorney General's role is to enforce the law. ”",

         "November 6, 2016 Greatest Basketball Player Of Our Era To Help First Woman President Beat Biggest Asshole Of All Time Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nHe is perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, certainly of the current era, and he's with her. \nCleveland's LeBron James has announced that he will be stumping for Hillary when she makes a stop in the crucial city in one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. James and Clinton will appear together at a get-out-the-vote rally at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio in the late afternoon. This will be James's first appearance with Clinton. In fact, a source says, the two have never met. James - a hero to many Ohio sports fans, especially in the African American community - could prove helpful to Clinton's effort to win the state's 18 electoral votes. While Clinton is handily beating Donald Trump among African American voters, she is struggling to gin up enthusiasm. According to the 2010 census, 53 percent of Clevelanders are African American. \nThe stakes could not be higher. If Clinton can win Ohio, there is almost no scenario in which Trump can win. If Ohio goes for Trump, then he has a real shot of becoming president. As Ohio's biggest star (sorry, John Kasich), James has a lot of power to motivate people to get out and vote. It could be a difference-maker in a tight election. \nJames' decision to stump with Hillary comes after other big-name celebrities publicly expressed their support for her campaign. Just days ago, musical power couple Beyonce and Jay Z held a concert in support of Clinton. The star power has spooked Trump's campaign, as evidenced by the fact that they are claiming the celebrities backing Hillary give her an “unfair” advantage. Trump, a man who once okay'd a DJ calling his daughter a “piece of ass” and who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” went so far as to lament the language used in some of Jay Z's songs. \n“He used every word in the book last night,” Trump said. “He used language last night that was so bad and then Hillary said, ‘I did not like Donald Trump's lewd language.' My lewd language. I tell you what, I've never said what he said in my life.” \nEye roll. \nMeanwhile, in related news, Trump will be campaigning with his own star power tonight. The cream of the crop. The best of the best. The A-lister…Ted Nugent. A man who once “ joked ” about shooting Hillary Clinton with a machine gun. \n“Obama, he's a piece of shit. I told him to suck on my machine gun. Hey Hillary,” he continued. “You might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch.” \nYeah, Trump sure seems concerned about what language musicians use. \nFeatured image via Jamie Sabau/Getty Images Share this Article!",

         "Thanksgiving by Glen Ford \n“The core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores - a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day.” No More American Thanksgivings by Glen Ford \nThis article originally appeared in the November 27, 2003 , issue of The Black Commentator, which Glen Ford co-founded and edited. \nNobody but Americans celebrates Thanksgiving. It is reserved by history and the intent of “the founders” as the supremely white American holiday, the most ghoulish event on the national calendar. No Halloween of the imagination can rival the exterminationist reality that was the genesis, and remains the legacy, of the American Thanksgiving. It is the most loathsome, humanity-insulting day of the year - a pure glorification of racist barbarity. \nWe at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four centuries-old abomination will be deprived of its reason for being: white supremacy. Then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of humanity's deliverance from the rule of evil men. \nThanksgiving is much more than a lie - if it were that simple, an historical correction of the record of events in 1600s Massachusetts would suffice to purge the “flaw” in the national mythology. But Thanksgiving is not just a twisted fable, and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil. The real-life events - subsequently revised - were perfectly understood at the time as the first, definitive triumphs of the genocidal European project in New England. The near-erasure of Native Americans in Massachusetts and, soon thereafter, from most of the remainder of the northern English colonial seaboard was the true mission of the Pilgrim enterprise - Act One of the American Dream. African Slavery commenced contemporaneously - an overlapping and ultimately inseparable Act Two. \nThe last Act in the American drama must be the “root and branch” eradication of all vestiges of Act One and Two - America's seminal crimes and formative projects. Thanksgiving as presently celebrated - that is, as a national political event - is an affront to civilization. \nCelebrating the unspeakable \nWhite America embraced Thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the fruits, if not the unpleasant details, of genocide and slavery and feels, on the whole, good about their heritage: a cornucopia of privilege and national power. Children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the Pilgrims. It does not much matter that the Native American and African holocausts that flowed from the feast at Plymouth are hidden from the children's version of the story - kids learn soon enough that Indians were made scarce and Africans became enslaved. But they will also never forget the core message of the holiday: that the Pilgrims were good people, who could not have purposely set such evil in motion. Just as the first Thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the English toehold in what became the United States, the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores - a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day. \nThe Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims - of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings - at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims' political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission. \nThanksgiving is quite dangerous - as were the Pilgrims. \nRejoicing in a cemetery \nThe English settlers, their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading company, were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in 1620. Corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the Wampanoags , but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled Rock. In a letter to England, Massachusetts Bay colony founder John Winthrop wrote, \"But for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection.\" \nEver diligent to claim their own advantages as God's will, the Pilgrims thanked their deity for having “pursued” the Indians to mass death. However, it was not divine intervention that wiped out most of the natives around the village of Patuxet but, most likely, smallpox-embedded blankets planted during an English visit or slave raid. Six years before the Pilgrim landing, a ship sailed into Patuxet's harbor, captained by none other than the famous seaman and mercenary soldier John Smith , former leader of the first successful English colony in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia. Epidemic and slavery followed in his wake, as Debra Glidden described in IMDiversity.com : \nIn 1614 the Plymouth Company of England, a joint stock company, hired Captain John Smith to explore land in its behalf. Along what is now the coast of Massachusetts in the territory of the Wampanoag, Smith visited the town of Patuxet according to \"The Colonial Horizon,\" a 1969 book edited by William Goetzinan. Smith renamed the town Plymouth in honor of his employers, but the Wampanoag who inhabited the town continued to call it Patuxet. \nThe following year Captain Hunt, an English slave trader, arrived at Patuxet. It was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them into slavery for 220 shillings apiece. That practice was described in a 1622 account of happenings entitled \"A Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia,\" written by Edward Waterhouse. True to the explorer tradition, Hunt kidnapped a number of Wampanoags to sell into slavery. \nAnother common practice among European explorers was to give \"smallpox blankets\" to the Indians. Since smallpox was unknown on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans did not have any natural immunity to the disease so smallpox would effectively wipe out entire villages with very little effort required by the Europeans. William Fenton describes how Europeans decimated Native American villages in his 1957 work \"American Indian and White relations to 1830.\" From 1615 to 1619 smallpox ran rampant among the Wampanoags and their neighbors to the north. The Wampanoag lost 70 percent of their population to the epidemic and the Massachusetts lost 90 percent. \nMost of the Wampanoag had died from the smallpox epidemic so when the Pilgrims arrived they found well-cleared fields which they claimed for their own. A Puritan colonist, quoted by Harvard University's Perry Miller, praised the plague that had wiped out the Indians for it was \"the wonderful preparation of the Lord Jesus Christ, by his providence for his people's abode in the Western world.\" \nHistorians have since speculated endlessly on why the woods in the region resembled a park to the disembarking Pilgrims in 1620. The reason should have been obvious: hundreds, if not thousands, of people had lived there just five years before. \nIn less than three generations the settlers would turn all of New England into a charnel house for Native Americans, and fire the economic engines of slavery throughout English-speaking America. Plymouth Rock is the place where the nightmare truly began. \nThe uninvited? \nIt is not at all clear what happened at the first - and only - “integrated” Thanksgiving feast. Only two written accounts of the three-day event exist, and one of them, by Governor William Bradford, was written 20 years after the fact. Was Chief Massasoit invited to bring 90 Indians with him to dine with 52 colonists, most of them women and children? This seems unlikely. A good harvest had provided the settlers with plenty of food, according to their accounts, so the whites didn't really need the Wampanoag's offering of five deer. What we do know is that there had been lots of tension between the two groups that fall. John Two-Hawks, who runs the Native Circle web site, gives a sketch of the facts: \n“Thanksgiving' did not begin as a great loving relationship between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag, Pequot and Narragansett people. In fact, in October of 1621 when the pilgrim survivors of their first winter in Turtle Island sat down to share the first unofficial 'Thanksgiving' meal, the Indians who were there were not even invited! There was no turkey, squash, cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie. A few days before this alleged feast took place, a company of 'pilgrims' led by Miles Standish actively sought the head of a local Indian chief, and an 11 foot high wall was erected around the entire Plymouth settlement for the very purpose of keeping Indians out!” \nIt is much more likely that Chief Massasoit either crashed the party, or brought enough men to ensure that he was not kidnapped or harmed by the Pilgrims. Dr. Tingba Apidta, in his “ Black Folks' Guide to Understanding Thanksgiving ,” surmises that the settlers “brandished their weaponry” early and got drunk soon thereafter. He notes that “each Pilgrim drank at least a half gallon of beer a day, which they preferred even to water. This daily inebriation led their governor, William Bradford, to comment on his people's ‘notorious sin,' which included their ‘drunkenness and uncleanliness' and rampant ‘sodomy.'” \nSoon after the feast the brutish Miles Standish “got his bloody prize,” Dr. Apidta writes: \n“He went to the Indians, pretended to be a trader, then beheaded an Indian man named Wituwamat. He brought the head to Plymouth, where it was displayed on a wooden spike for many years, according to Gary B. Nash, ‘as a symbol of white power.' Standish had the Indian man's young brother hanged from the rafters for good measure. From that time on, the whites were known to the Indians of Massachusetts by the name ‘Wotowquenange,' which in their tongue meant cutthroats and stabbers.” \nWhat is certain is that the first feast was not called a “Thanksgiving” at the time; no further integrated dining occasions were scheduled; and the first, official all-Pilgrim “Thanksgiving” had to wait until 1637, when the whites of New England celebrated the massacre of the Wampanoag's southern neighbors, the Pequots. \nThe real Thanksgiving Day Massacre \nThe Pequots today own the Foxwood Casino and Hotel , in Ledyard, Connecticut, with gross gaming revenues of over $9 billion in 2000. This is truly a (very belated) miracle, since the real first Pilgrim Thanksgiving was intended as the Pequot's epitaph. Sixteen years after the problematical Plymouth feast, the English tried mightily to erase the Pequots from the face of the Earth, and thanked God for the blessing. \nHaving subdued, intimidated or made mercenaries of most of the tribes of Massachusetts, the English turned their growing force southward, toward the rich Connecticut valley, the Pequot's sphere of influence. At the point where the Mystic River meets the sea, the combined force of English and allied Indians bypassed the Pequot fort to attack and set ablaze a town full of women, children and old people. \nWilliam Bradford, the former Governor of Plymouth and one of the chroniclers of the 1621 feast, was also on hand for the great massacre of 1637: \n\"Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire...horrible was the stink and scent thereof, but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy.\" \nThe rest of the white folks thought so, too. “This day forth shall be a day of celebration and thanksgiving for subduing the Pequots,\" read Governor John Winthrop's proclamation. The authentic Thanksgiving Day was born. \nMost historians believe about 700 Pequots were slaughtered at Mystic. Many prisoners were executed, and surviving women and children sold into slavery in the West Indies. Pequot prisoners that escaped execution were parceled out to Indian tribes allied with the English. The Pequot were thought to have been extinguished as a people. According to IndyMedia , “The Pequot tribe numbered 8,000 when the Pilgrims arrived, but disease had brought their numbers down to 1,500 by 1637. The Pequot ‘War' killed all but a handful of remaining members of the tribe.” \nBut there were still too many Indians around to suit the whites of New England, who bided their time while their own numbers increased to critical, murderous mass. \nGuest's head on a pole \nBy the 1670s the colonists, with 8,000 men under arms, felt strong enough to demand that the Pilgrims' former dinner guests the Wampanoags disarm and submit to the authority of the Crown. After a series of settler provocations in 1675, the Wampanoag struck back, under the leadership of Chief Metacomet, son of Massasoit, called King Philip by the English. Metacomet/Philip, whose wife and son were captured and sold into West Indian slavery, wiped out 13 settlements and killed 600 adult white men before the tide of battle turned. A 1996 issue of the Revolutionary Worker provides an excellent narrative. \nIn their victory, the settlers launched an all-out genocide against the remaining Native people. The Massachusetts government offered 20 shillings bounty for every Indian scalp, and 40 shillings for every prisoner who could be sold into slavery. Soldiers were allowed to enslave any Indian woman or child under 14 they could capture. The \"Praying Indians\" who had converted to Christianity and fought on the side of the European troops were accused of shooting into the treetops during battles with \"hostiles.\" They were enslaved or killed. Other \"peaceful\" Indians of Dartmouth and Dover were invited to negotiate or seek refuge at trading posts - and were sold onto slave ships. \nIt is not known how many Indians were sold into slavery, but in this campaign, 500 enslaved Indians were shipped from Plymouth alone. Of the 12,000 Indians in the surrounding tribes, probably about half died from battle, massacre and starvation. \nAfter King Philip's War, there were almost no Indians left free in the northern British colonies. A colonist wrote from Manhattan's New York colony: \"There is now but few Indians upon the island and those few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have decreased by the hand of God, since the English first settled in these parts.\" In Massachusetts, the colonists declared a \"day of public thanksgiving\" in 1676, saying, \"there now scarce remains a name or family of them [the Indians] but are either slain, captivated or fled.\" \nFifty-five years after the original Thanksgiving Day, the Puritans had destroyed the generous Wampanoag and all other neighboring tribes. The Wampanoag chief King Philip was beheaded. His head was stuck on a pole in Plymouth, where the skull still hung on display 24 years later. \nThis is not thought to be a fit Thanksgiving tale for the children of today, but it's the real story, well-known to the settler children of New England at the time - the white kids who saw the Wampanoag head on the pole year after year and knew for certain that God loved them best of all, and that every atrocity they might ever commit against a heathen, non-white was blessed. \nThere's a good term for the process thus set in motion: nation-building. \nRoots of the slave trade \nThe British North American colonists' practice of enslaving Indians for labor or direct sale to the West Indies preceded the appearance of the first chained Africans at the dock in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The Jamestown colonists' human transaction with the Dutch vessel was an unscheduled occurrence. However, once the African slave trade became commercially established, the fates of Indians and Africans in the colonies became inextricably entwined. New England, born of up-close-and-personal, burn-them-in-the-fires-of-hell genocide, led the political and commercial development of the English colonies. The region also led the nascent nation's descent into a slavery-based society and economy. \nIronically, an apologist for Virginian slavery made one of the best, early cases for the indictment of New England as the engine of the American slave trade. Unreconstructed secessionist Lewis Dabney's 1867 book “ A Defense of Virginia ” traced the slave trade's origins all the way back to Plymouth Rock: \nThe planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth, in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The other trading colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire (which never had an extensive shipping interest), were offshoots of Massachusetts. They partook of the same characteristics and pursuits; and hence, the example of the parent colony is taken here as a fair representation of them. \nThe first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire , Captain Pierce, of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the \"Puritan Fathers\" embarked in this business may be comprehended, when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. [Note: the year they massacred the Pequots.] The first feeble and dubious foothold was gained by the white man at Plymouth less than seventeen years before; and as is well known, many years were expended by the struggle of the handful of settlers for existence. So that it may be correctly said, that the commerce of New England was born of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it. The Desire , proceeding to the Bahamas, with a cargo of \"dry fish and strong liquors, the only commodities for those parts,\" obtained the negroes from two British men-of-war, which had captured them from a Spanish slaver. \nThus, the trade of which the good ship Desire , of Salem, was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence, Newport, and New Haven became famous slave trading ports. The magnificent harbor of the second, especially, was the favorite starting-place of the slave ships; and its commerce rivaled, or even exceeded, that of the present commercial metropolis, New York. All the four original States, of course, became slaveholding. \nThe Revolution that exploded in 1770s New England was undertaken by men thoroughly imbued with the worldview of the Indian-killer and slave-holder. How could they not be? The “country” they claimed as their own was fathered by genocide and mothered by slavery - its true distinction among the commercial nations of the world. And these men were not ashamed, but proud, with vast ambition to spread their exceptional characteristics West and South and wherever their so-far successful project in nation-building might take them - and by the same bloody, savage methods that had served them so well in the past. \nAt the moment of deepest national crisis following the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the national fable that is far more central to the white American personality than Lincoln's battlefield “Address.” Lincoln seized upon the 1621 feast as the historic “Thanksgiving” - bypassing the official and authentic 1637 precedent - and assigned the dateless, murky event the fourth Thursday in November. \nLincoln surveyed a broken nation, and attempted nation-rebuilding, based on the purest white myth. The same year that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he renewed the national commitment to a white manifest destiny that began at Plymouth Rock. Lincoln sought to rekindle a shared national mission that former Confederates and Unionists and white immigrants from Europe could collectively embrace. It was and remains a barbaric and racist national unifier, by definition. Only the most fantastic lies can sanitize the history of the Plymouth Colony of Massachusetts. \n”Like a rock” \nThe Thanksgiving holiday fable is at once a window on the way that many, if not most, white Americans view the world and their place in it, and a pollutant that leaches barbarism into the modern era. The fable attempts to glorify the indefensible, to enshrine an era and mission that represent the nation's lowest moral denominators . Thanksgiving as framed in the mythology is, consequently, a drag on that which is potentially civilizing in the national character, a crippling, atavistic deformity. Defenders of the holiday will claim that the politically-corrected children's version promotes brotherhood, but that is an impossibility - a bald excuse to prolong the worship of colonial “forefathers” and to erase the crimes they committed. Those bastards burned the Pequot women and children, and ushered in the multinational business of slavery. These are facts. The myth is an insidious diversion - and worse. \nHumanity cannot tolerate a 21st Century superpower, much of whose population perceives the world through the eyes of 17th Century land and flesh bandits. Yet that is the trick that fate has played on the globe. We described the roots of the planetary dilemma in our March 13 commentary, “ Racism & War, Perfect Together. ” \nThe English arrived with criminal intent - and brought wives and children to form new societies predicated on successful plunder. To justify the murderous enterprise, Indians who had initially cooperated with the squatters were transmogrified into \"savages\" deserving displacement and death. The relentlessly refreshed lie of Indian savagery became a truth in the minds of white Americans, a fact to be acted upon by every succeeding generation of whites. The settlers became a singular people confronting the great \"frontier\" - a euphemism for centuries of genocidal campaigns against a darker, \"savage\" people marked for extinction. \nThe necessity of genocide was the operative, working assumption of the expanding American nation. \"Manifest Destiny\" was born at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, later to fall (to paraphrase Malcolm) like a rock on Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Little children were taught that the American project was inherently good, Godly, and that those who got in the way were \"evil-doers\" or just plain subhuman, to be gloriously eliminated. The lie is central to white American identity, embraced by waves of European settlers who never saw a red person. \nOnly a century ago, American soldiers caused the deaths of possibly a million Filipinos whom they had been sent to “liberate” from Spanish rule. They didn't even know who they were killing, and so rationalized their behavior by substituting the usual American victims. Colonel Funston , of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, explained what got him motivated in the Philippines: \n\"Our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces.\" Another wrote that \"the boys go for the enemy as if they were chasing jack-rabbits .... I, for one, hope that Uncle Sam will apply the chastening rod, good, hard, and plenty, and lay it on until they come into the reservation and promise to be good 'Injuns.'\" \nLast week in northern Iraq another American colonel, Joe Anderson of the 101st Airborne (Assault) Division, revealed that he is incapable of perceiving Arabs as human beings. Colonel Anderson, who doubles as a commander and host of a radio call-in program and a TV show designed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Mosul, had learned that someone was out to assassinate him. In the wild mood swing common to racists, Anderson decided that Iraqis are all alike - and of a different breed. He said as much to the Los Angeles Times . \n\"They don't understand being nice,\" said Anderson, who helps oversee the military zone that includes Mosul and environs. He doesn't hide his irritation after months dedicated to restoring the city: \"We spent so long here working with kid gloves, but the average Iraqi guy will tell you, 'The only thing people respect here is violence…. They only understand being shot at, being killed. That's the culture.' … Nice guys do finish last here.\" \nCol. Anderson personifies the unfitness of Americans to play a major role in the world, much less rule it. \"We poured a lot of our heart and soul into trying to help the people,” he bitched, as if Americans were God's gift to the planet. \"But it can be frustrating when you hear stupid people still saying, 'You're occupiers. You want our oil. You're turning our country over to Israel.'” He cannot fathom that other people - non-whites - aspire to run their own affairs, and will kill and die to achieve that basic right. \nWhat does this have to do with the Mayflower? Everything. Although possibly against their wishes, the Pilgrims hosted the Wampanoag for three no doubt anxious days. The same men killed and enslaved Wampanoags immediately before and after the feast. They, their newly arrived English comrades and their children roasted hundreds of neighboring Indians alive just 16 years later, and two generations afterwards cleared nearly the whole of New England of its indigenous “savages,” while enthusiastically enriching themselves through the invention of transoceanic, sophisticated means of enslaving millions. The Mayflower's cultural heirs are programmed to find glory in their own depravity, and savagery in their most helpless victims, who can only redeem themselves by accepting the inherent goodness of white Americans. \nThanksgiving encourages these cognitive cripples in their madness, just as it is designed to do.",

         "Robert Durst Pleads Not Guilty to 2000 Murder in Los Angeles - The New York Times",
         "Charles V. Bagli",
         "LOS ANGELES  —   Robert A. Durst, the multimillionaire whose bizarre life of privilege and mayhem was the subject of a 2015 documentary, was arraigned here on Monday on charges of murdering a onetime confidante 16 years ago. Mr. Durst is accused of having shot his friend, Susan Berman, to stop her from revealing any secrets behind his first wife's disappearance in 1982. Ms. Berman was shot once in the back of the head in her Benedict Canyon home shortly after Mr. Durst said she told him that the authorities in New York wanted to talk to her about what happened to his wife. Mr. Durst, 73, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace, appeared before Judge Mark Windham in Los Angeles County Superior Court and entered a plea of not guilty. He had orange prison slippers on his feet. Answeringa procedural question from the judge, Mr. Durst said in a hoarse, low voice: “I am not guilty. I did not kill Susan Berman. ” Later, outside the courthouse, his lead defense lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said the same thing. “Bob is not guilty,” Mr. DeGuerin said. “He did not kill Susan Berman. He doesn't know who did. ” Deputy District Attorney John Lewin said the state would not seek the death penalty against Mr. Durst. Both sides agreed to convene again on Feb. 15 to set the date for a preliminary hearing. Mr. Durst was arrested in New Orleans in March 2015 on a murder warrant issued in Los Angeles. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the illegal possession of a firearm. On Friday, he was transferred here from federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind. to stand trial. Suspicions have surrounded Mr. Durst since 1982, when his first wife, Kathleen Durst, disappeared from the couple's stone cottage in Westchester County, N. Y. His friends and relatives believed that Mr. Durst, a member of the wealthy real estate family that runs the Durst Organization, was involved. He was never charged in connection with the case. Mr. Durst met Ms. Berman during the late 1960s at the University of California, Los Angeles, where they were students. Friends say there was an immediate bond. They came from wealthy families and had lost their mothers at a young age, possibly to suicide. Ms. Berman, the daughter of Davie Berman, a mobster who was a partner in Bugsy Siegel's Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, became a journalist and a screenwriter. “We became fast friends,” Mr. Durst said during courtroom testimony in Galveston, Tex. “We were never boyfriend and girlfriend. ” Mr. Durst counted on Ms. Berman to shield him from the press when his wife's sudden disappearance generated tabloid headlines in New York. He walked her down the aisle when she married at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles in 1984. He left the family business in 1994 after his father, Seymour Durst, appointed his younger brother Douglas to take control of the Durst Organization. He has been estranged from his family since then  —   Douglas is expected to testify for the prosecution in Los Angeles  —   and for years led a peripatetic life, moving restlessly among California, New York and Texas, even as he became a suspect in three murders. But it was Mr. Durst's own hubris that brought his freewheeling ways to an end. Beginning in 2010, he agreed to participate in the documentary  —   “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst”  —   about his life and the murder allegations, which was eventually broadcast on HBO in February and March 2015. His friends and lawyers had advised him not to participate for fear of antagonizing prosecutors. But Mr. Durst told The New York Times he thought there was “no reason I shouldn't say anything I want to anyone I want,” because it was unlikely that any prosecutor would undertake a “ ” investigation for a couple of cold cases. In “The Jinx,” Mr. Durst said Ms. Berman contacted him in October 2000 saying the authorities wanted to talk to her about his first wife. In quick succession, he married his current wife, Debrah Lee Charatan, and fled New York, renting modest apartments in Galveston and New Orleans while posing as a mute woman. In December of that year, Ms. Berman's body was found in her Los Angeles home, the back door open and her dogs running loose. Initially, the police focused not on Mr. Durst but on Ms. Berman's landlady and her agent. But the authorities came to suspect that Mr. Durst was the author of a short anonymous note sent to the Beverly Hills police the same day Ms. Berman was found dead, saying there was a “cadaver” in her home. The makers of “The Jinx” obtained a letter he wrote to her in which the lettering of the address on the envelope appears identical to that of the “cadaver” note, down to the misspelling of Beverly Hills as “Beverley. ” In 2001, when Mr. Durst was living in Texas, body parts of his elderly neighbor were found floating in Galveston Bay, and Mr. Durst was charged with his murder. He was acquitted in 2003, despite his testimony of how he sat in a pool of blood while cutting up the body. Mr. Durst insisted that the man's death was an accident and an act of  . Mr. Durst said during a 2015 interview that he did not have “the faintest idea” what happened to Ms. Berman, or to Ms. Durst, although he conceded in “The Jinx” that he had lied to the police about his whereabouts when his wife disappeared  —   “Nobody tells the whole truth,” he said  —   and that their relationship had descended into rounds of “fighting, slapping, pushing. ” “The Jinx” ended with Mr. Durst's own words in an unguarded moment: “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course. ” Just hours before the final episode of the documentary was broadcast, Mr. Durst was arrested in New Orleans. The police feared he was about to flee the country. There is very little forensic evidence in either case and no apparent witnesses as to what happened to either woman. Prosecutors will have to rely on the   memories of the people who knew the two women and Mr. Durst. But Mr. Durst left footprints and provided leads for the authorities when he granted access to the producers of “The Jinx” to his credit card receipts, phone bills and legal papers, which put him in California at the time of Ms. Berman's killing when he gave a lengthy deposition in 2005 as part of a lawsuit against the Durst family trust and when he spoke for 90 minutes with John Lewin, the Los Angeles prosecutor, after his arrest in New Orleans. But all of that is likely to be the subject of fierce litigation before trial, as the defense moves to exclude the material. Mr. DeGuerin has described “The Jinx” as a “sensationalized docudrama. ” Mr. Durst has also told falsehoods over the years, which could cast doubt over both his protestations of innocence and his damaging admissions. He told Ms. Berman and other friends that he witnessed his mother's fall or leap from the roof of his childhood home in 1950, but Douglas Durst said that  he was not there. He testified in court in Galveston that he was “relieved” that his father did not hand him the family business, after telling friends in the 1990s that he was so furious with his father that he refused to attend Seymour's funeral. Even if Mr. Durst is ultimately found not guilty of murder, he will go back to prison to complete his   sentence on the gun charge.",

         "Heather Dietrick, Gawker Media's president and general counsel, has always been close to her    grandfather, a prisoner of war during World War II who, she said, “has taught me a lot about fielding a lot of situations. ” She still wears his vocational high school class ring from 1943 as a reminder that people can get through anything if they are resilient. It's the kind of inspiration that has helped Ms. Dietrick make it through the last 11 months at Gawker. These have been tumultuous times, perhaps never more so than last Friday at noon at the company's Manhattan offices. After taking a few moments to collect her thoughts, Ms. Dietrick joined Nick Denton, Gawker's founder and chief executive, at a companywide meeting. There they told some 200 employees that Gawker, facing a $140 million judgment from a lawsuit by the retired wrestler Hulk Hogan, had filed for bankruptcy and was putting itself up for sale. As she stood beside Mr. Denton and delivered the news, Ms. Dietrick said in an interview over the weekend, she looked at her audience. “I could tell there was initial shock, seeing everyone and looking them in the eyes. ” Ms. Dietrick and Mr. Denton spent much of the   meeting answering questions and assuring the employees that the company planned to continue its operations during its bankruptcy. As has recently become customary, Ms. Dietrick did most of the talking. Since joining Gawker three years ago, Ms. Dietrick, 35, has become the main source of support during a chaotic time for the company. Most general counsels work in obscurity, but Ms. Dietrick, with the added responsibilities of president, has taken on more of a leadership role at Gawker as Mr. Denton has pulled back from the    operations. Throughout the Hulk Hogan case, she has been the bridge between the newsroom and Gawker's legal proceedings. She manages much of the company's editorial operations and has a formal role in editorial  . And though Mr. Denton is still arguably the public face of Gawker, she has been called on repeatedly to represent the company during periods of turmoil. “The place would not run without Heather,” Mr. Denton said in a recent interview. “She's the person that holds everything together. ” In the last year, Ms. Dietrick, who has both a law degree and an M. B. A. from the University of Michigan, has had to try to steer the company through one crisis after another. Last month, the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times that he was financially supporting the Hogan lawsuit and other legal cases against the company. That put Gawker at the center of a First Amendment battle that has captivated the media world while highlighting a deepening chasm between an ascendant technology industry and a journalism business buffeted by financial challenges. In the interview on Saturday, Ms. Dietrick said that Gawker began seriously considering filing for bankruptcy once Mr. Thiel's involvement in the Hogan case became known. The pivotal moment came on Friday at around 11 a. m. after a hearing in which a Florida judge affirmed the $140 million judgment in the Hogan case and granted Gawker's request for a stay, but under conditions that the company found too onerous, Ms. Dietrick said. The conditions included allowing Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, to get liens on the company's assets. Gawker had considered the option of filing for bankruptcy within a few days, Ms. Dietrick said. But as its lawyers in Florida provided updates on the hearing by phone, she and Mr. Denton decided the company could not wait any longer because they feared it would be unable to continue to operate otherwise. “The timeline was pushed forward a little more quickly than we expected,” Ms. Dietrick said on Saturday. “As of yesterday, it was inevitable that we were going to go through with the sale. ” The company still plans to appeal the judgment. Gawker has had its fair share of detractors, and on Twitter and in comments in news articles, some cheered the company's fate. Ms. Dietrick said any suggestion that Gawker got what it deserved was “absurd. ” She said that the company had certainly “overstepped the line a couple of times” but that it was proud of nearly all of the stories it had done over the years. Ms. Dietrick said she was committed to staying at Gawker but acknowledged that its future was uncertain. The company said on Friday that it would conduct a sale through an auction and expected to close a deal by the end of the summer. Ziff Davis, a digital media company, has submitted an opening bid in the range of $90 million to $100 million. It was not clear whether a buyer would want all of Gawker's sites, and it is possible that Mr. Denton might consider buying back Gawker. com at some point. Nearly everyone who works with Ms. Dietrick, who was in Hearst's legal department before coming to Gawker in May 2013, describes her as nice. But that belies her steeliness in difficult situations. They also say she has brought a sense of professionalism and diplomacy that helps balance Gawker's notoriously freewheeling spirit. She has built up a team of four lawyers including herself who handle vetting, contracts, licensing deals and most of the company's other legal matters. And she has gained the trust of editorial staff members, who view her more as a partner than an adversary. Women at Gawker say they see her as an advocate at a company that has been criticized in the past for how it treats female employees. She often works on her laptop on a couch in the lounge area near the editorial team and goes out for drinks with employees. On Friday evening, she invited staff members to a rooftop gathering at her apartment building in the West Village, where she lives with her husband. People ordered pizzas and drank beer. Ms. Dietrick firmly believes in Gawker's approach to news, current and former employees say. She is a staunch defender of the First Amendment and would rather figure out a way to tell a story than prevent it from running. “She believes in what we do as much, if not more, than I do,” said John Cook, Gawker Media's executive editor. Last July, Gawker published an article claiming that a married male media executive had sought to hire a gay escort. The article drew a firestorm of criticism and there was considerable debate at the company about whether to remove the post. Mr. Denton ultimately decided to take it down after a vote that he said showed that the company's management, including Ms. Dietrick, was largely in favor of doing so. But Ms. Dietrick maintained that she wanted to keep it online and that her stance was misconstrued. “I knew the world was going to have a discussion about it,” she said. “I think it's hard to talk about things once they've been disappeared. ” Some colleagues suggest that her numerous roles may have stretched her too thin. “She actually has more jobs than one human should probably have,” said Hamilton Nolan, a writer who has worked at Gawker for eight years. Some in the media legal community question whether it makes sense for Ms. Dietrick to hold general counsel and president roles. Acting as both executive and lawyer, they say, can complicate   privilege. Ms. Dietrick said she did not think her dual role was “that odd,” but acknowledged that the last year had been tough. “I feel like my job has been removing roadblocks,” she said. For all of the challenges, however, it is largely because of her roles at Gawker that Ms. Dietrick is now enjoying much more prominence than most general counsels ever do. “If I were her, I wouldn't be unhappy being in her position,” said Sandra S. Baron, a First Amendment media lawyer and a former executive director of the Media Law Resource Center. “There's nothing humdrum about what she's doing now. ”",

         "Re: The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here",
         "Tatiana Covington",
         "The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here   15th, 2016 \nA record-setting drought has gripped the southern United States, but most people have no idea that this drought is the fulfillment of a prophecy that was given four years ago. Back in 2008, John Paul Jackson released a DVD entitled “ The Perfect Storm ” in which he detailed many of the prophetic events that God showed him would soon come to America. In 2012, he released a video update to “The Perfect Storm” that you can view on YouTube right here . In that update, he shared a list of future headlines that God had revealed to him over the years. Some of these headlines have already happened since that time, and now we are watching another be fulfilled right in front of our eyes. \nSpecifically, I am referring to this headline: “Record High Temps Accompany Record Drought Swept South” . \nIn an article entitled “ July's Extreme Heat Breaks Records Across South “, weather.com detailed many of the high temperature records that have been broken in the South in recent months, but in this article I am going to focus on the crippling drought that is plaguing the region. \nIn addition to the headline above, John Paul Jackson was shown several other headlines regarding drought and famine coming to America… \n“Drought Continues to Cause Prayer to Rise” \n“Demand for Classic Seeds Skyrockets” \n“Food Prices Lead Nation's Escalating Inflation Woes” \n“Sysco and Kraft Consider Guards on Delivery Trucks as Food Nears 40% of the Family Budget” \nAnd of course John Paul Jackson is not the only one that has been shown that these things are coming to this nation. \nThe following is a very small portion of what Terry Bennett was shown in April 2011 … \nI was also warned, by the appearing of the black horse and its rider, about famine. The angel said, “There will be a famine of food in your nation!” Not only this, but also the prices of food, particularly grains, will dramatically rise. We will see not only shortages and high prices, but I was shown significant starvation occurring during this time. Death followed this black horse! \nDr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories of Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and she was also shown that famine is going to hit America … \n“I'm instructing my children to begin to fill up their storehouses before the famine strikes just as I instructed Joseph while he was in Egypt.” \nWith those prophecies in mind, it is extremely alarming to see what is happening all across the southern portion of the United States right now. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor , most of the southern half of the country is experiencing some level of drought at this moment… \nThe drought in California has been raging for quite some time, but what has surprised the experts is how dry it has been in the Southeast lately. The following is from an EcoWatch article entitled “ Record-Breaking Drought and Wildfires Plague Southeast “… \nThe atmospheric spigots have been turned off across most of the U.S. over the last several weeks. According to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report from Nov. 10, more than 27 percent of the contiguous U.S. has been enveloped by at least moderate drought (categories D1 through D4). This is the largest percentage value in more than a year, since late October 2015 . \nThe upward trend of the last month is worrisome given the outlook for the coming winter: Drier-than-average conditions are projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration across the southern half of the contiguous U.S., a frequent outcome during La Niña winters. \nTo say that the drought in the Southeast is severe would be a tremendous understatement. At this point, some cities in the Southeast haven't seen any measurable rain in about 50 days … \nNo measurable rain (at least .01 inches) has been tallied at Birmingham's Shuttlesworth International Airport since Sept. 18, approaching a two-month-long dry streak, topping their previous longest dry streak on record - 52 straight days - from fall 1924. \nNine minutes of sprinkles Nov. 4 and another bout of sprinkles on Oct. 16 has been the entirety of Birmingham's rainfall so far this fall. \nAnniston, Alabama, and Rome, Georgia, have dry streaks now approaching 50 days. \nAnd unfortunately, it appears that there is not going to be any substantial rain for the region any time soon … \nThere are no signs of any significant rainfall through the end of the month across the Southeast, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity said. \nThe region needs days and weeks of a steady, soaking rain to completely eliminate the drought. \n“Things will only get worse before they get better,” Margusity explained. \nWhenever conditions are this dry, it is inevitable that there will be wildfires. \nRight now more than 100 major wildfires are raging across the Southeast, and some of the worst are in the mountains of North Carolina. \nAs you read this article, more than 1,000 firefighters are battling dozens of large wildfires in the North Carolina mountains. Governor Pat McCrory is referring to these fires as “ California wildfires in North Carolina “, and he is not exaggerating one bit. \nIf what we are witnessing is truly the beginning of the fulfillment of what God showed John Paul Jackson, Terry Bennett and Patricia Green, then we should expect drought conditions to continue to intensify in the months ahead. \nAnd as you can see above, they are saying that things will eventually get so bad that famine will strike America. \nMost of us couldn't imagine something like that ever happening in this nation. But these are men and women of God with very long track records. As I noted above, Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories by Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and John Paul Jackson has a track record of correctly fulfilled prophecies that is exceedingly long. \nAs I end this article, I also want to remind everyone of what God showed Heidi Baker regarding the future of America not too long ago … \nI saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell. I mean they are in shredded rags. They don't have shoes or they have flip flops. Most of them [have] no shoes. They are hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food, not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry. \nThese days a lot of Americans have become complacent and are feeling pretty good about things. \nBut the events that are warned about in this article are coming, and I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can.",

         "3 Win the Pritzker, Long a Prize for Starchitects - The New York Times",
         "Robin Pogrebin",
         "In perhaps the clearest signal yet that the era of the solo celebrity architect is behind us, three friends who hung out a shingle in their Catalonian hometown, Olot, Spain, 30 years ago and never left or parted ways have won their profession's highest honor: the Pritzker Prize. Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta on Wednesday became the first team of three to be selected for the prize, which will be awarded in Tokyo on May 20. “Their intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally, led to the selection of the three individuals for this year's award,” Thomas J. Pritzker, the chairman of Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said in a statement, adding, “Mr. Aranda, Ms. Pigem and Mr. Vilalta have had an impact on the discipline far beyond their immediate area. ” Ms. Pigem, who spoke for the group because her English is strongest, said in a telephone interview that the collaboration was integral to the practice. “For us, it's very important to work together  —   one of the most important things we talk about is shared creativity,” she said. “It's not a question of one person it's all three. Sometimes we say six hands, one voice. ” The architects are not widely known they have not designed major public projects or worked much outside Spain. But they came to the attention of the Pritzker jury because their works, if modest, “admirably and poetically fulfill the traditional requirements of architecture for physical and spatial beauty along with function and craftsmanship,” the citation said. “But what sets them apart is their approach that creates buildings and places that are both local and universal at the same time. ” The team's buildings include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, featuring boldly modern metallic architecture (in collaboration with G. Trégouët, 2014) and a   complex in Barcelona, Spain (Sant Antoni  —   Joan Oliver, 2007) that incorporates a library, a center for the elderly and a children's playground. The design features ample views of interior gardens and sky, and metal corridors that nod to the site's industrial past as a candy factory. They also continue to work on projects in their Catalonian home turf, like the   athletics track, completed in 2000, and the covered   Les Cols restaurant in 2011, with plastic walls of trees, between which real trees grow. In 1988, one year after completing their studies in architecture at the School of Architecture in Vallès, the three won first prize in a competition sponsored by the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Urbanism, to design a lighthouse in Punta Aldea. “We said, O. K.,” Ms. Pigem said. “Maybe we can do something good in architecture. ” They founded their firm that year, calling it RCR Arquitectes, after the initials of their first names. For the lighthouse, they had pondered “the essence of the typology,” according to their Pritzker biography. The team members have brought a   sensibility to their built projects, as well as their work as consultant architects to the natural park in the volcanic zone of La Garrotxa. “For us, what is very, very important is the relationship to the site,” Ms. Pigem said. “If the site is natural, or if the site is a building, or if the site is a city. What is important is to study the strong and unique relationship between the existing and the new. ” In 2007, they converted an    foundry into their office, Barberí Laboratory. They are the second Pritzker laureates to come from Spain Rafael Moneo received the award in 1996. Ms. Pigem, who is married to Mr. Vilalta, said she and her colleagues “feel very excited and very joyful. ” The Pritzker jury said it was important to reward a local firm in an increasingly globalized world. “More and more people fear that because of this international influence,” the citation said, “we will lose our local values, our local art and our local customs. ” “They help us to see, in a most beautiful and poetic way, that the answer to the question is not ‘ ' and that we can, at least in architecture, aspire to have both,” it continued, “our roots firmly in place and our arms outstretched to the rest of the world. ”",

         "Donald Trump Adjusts His Complaints About Debate Microphone - The New York Times",
         "Maggie Haberman",
         "During a    event in New Hampshire on Thursday night, Donald J. Trump made a passing remark about the first presidential debate last week and about the audio equipment that he has blamed for his    performance. “It wasn't that the mike didn't work,” Mr. Trump said, during comments about the difficulties he had faced during the debate. The problem, he said, was that the people operating the soundboard had been “oscillating” as he spoke, changing the levels of his voice. In any other election, this would have been an anodyne comment. But it came after Mr. Trump had spent days insisting he had had a “bum mike” and theorizing that there may have been foul play. Mr. Trump's new comments may be obscured somewhat by the arrival of Hurricane Matthew. But, ahead of the crucial second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday, they represented an adjustment by Mr. Trump of what had been a rallying cry portraying him as a potential victim of sabotage. In an email Thursday evening, a Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, pointed to a brief statement by the Commission on Presidential Debates last week saying that an audio issue had affected how Mr. Trump was heard in the hall. “We'd like to reiterate, as the commission stated independently, that Mr. Trump experienced audio issues the night of the debate,” Ms. Hicks said. “Regardless of the exact technical cause or effect, it was unfortunate. ” The event on Thursday was intended to help Mr. Trump find a comfort zone before the Sunday debate, which shares the    format. But it was moderated by a friendly conservative radio host, questions were screened in advance, and Mr. Trump spoke for only about 30 minutes. Mr. Trump, who faced some criticism for seeming ill prepared for the first debate, will spend time today and over the weekend preparing for the second. But the hurricane  —   potentially the worst to hit the United States in many years  —   threatens to drown out attention on the race, perhaps even on debate day.",

         "Online School Enriches Affiliated Companies if Not Its Students - The New York Times",
         "Motoko Rich",
         "COLUMBUS, Ohio  —   The Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, an online charter school based here, graduated 2, 371 students last spring. At the commencement ceremony, a student speaker triumphantly told her classmates that the group was “the   graduating high school class in the nation. ” What she did not say was this: Despite the huge number of graduates  —   this year, the school is on track to graduate 2, 300  —   more students drop out of the Electronic Classroom or fail to finish high school within four years than at any other school in the country, according to federal data. For every 100 students who graduate on time, 80 do not. Even as the national   graduation rate has hit a record high of 82 percent, publicly funded online schools like the Electronic Classroom have become the new dropout factories. These schools take on students with unorthodox needs  —   like serious medical problems or experiences with bullying  —   that traditional districts may find difficult to meet. But with no physical classrooms and high    ratios, they cannot provide support in person. “If you're disconnected or struggling or you haven't done well in school before, it's going to be tough to succeed in this environment,” said Robert Balfanz, the director of the Everyone Graduates Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Baltimore. Virtual schools have experienced explosive growth nationwide in recent years, financed mostly by state money. But according to a report released on Tuesday by America's Promise Alliance, a consortium of education advocacy groups, the average graduation rate at online schools is 40 percent. Few states have as many students in   as Ohio. Online charter schools here are educating one out of every 26 high school students, yet their graduation rates are worse than those in the state's most impoverished cities, including Cleveland and Youngstown. With 17, 000 pupils, most in high school, the Electronic Classroom is the largest online school in the state. Students and teachers work from home on computers, communicating by email or on the school's web platform at distances that can be hundreds of miles apart. In 2014, the school's graduation rate did not even reach 39 percent. Because of this poor record, as well as concerns about student performance on standardized tests, the school is now under “corrective action” by a state regulator, which is determining its next steps. But while some students may not have found success at the school, the Electronic Classroom has richly rewarded private companies affiliated with its founder, William Lager, a software executive. When students enroll in the Electronic Classroom or in other online charters, a proportion of the state money allotted for each pupil is redirected from traditional school districts to the cyberschools. At the Electronic Classroom, which Mr. Lager founded in 2000, the money has been used to help enrich   companies that he leads. Those companies provide school services, including instructional materials and public relations. For example, in the 2014 fiscal year, the last year for which federal tax filings were available, the school paid the companies associated with Mr. Lager nearly $23 million, or about   of the nearly $115 million in government funds it took in. Critics say the companies associated with Mr. Lager have not delivered much value. “I don't begrudge people making money if they really can build a better mousetrap,” said Stephen Dyer, a former Ohio state legislator and the education policy fellow at Innovation Ohio, a Columbus think tank that is sharply critical of online charter schools. “It's clear that Mr. Lager has not done a service over all to kids, and certainly not appreciably better than even the most struggling school districts in the state,” Mr. Dyer added. “But he's becoming incredibly wealthy doing a very mediocre job for kids. ” Mr. Lager declined requests for an interview. In an emailed statement on Tuesday, he did not respond to questions about his affiliated companies but said the Electronic Classroom's graduation rate did not accurately measure the school's performance. In the statement, he said many students arrived at the school already   and have trouble making up the course credits in time to graduate. “Holding a school accountable for such students is like charging a relief pitcher with a loss when they enter a game three runs behind and wiping out the record of the starting pitcher,” his statement said. The statement added that the school “should be judged based on an accountability system that successfully controls for the academic effects of demographic factors such as poverty, special needs and mobility. ” In an interview, Rick Teeters, the superintendent of the Electronic Classroom, said many of the students were older than was typical for their grade, while others faced serious life challenges, including pregnancy or poverty. Mr. Lager is correct in noting that the student body at the Electronic Classroom is highly mobile last year more than half the school's students enrolled for less than the full school year. And of those who dropped out of high school, half were forced to withdraw after being reported truant. Also, according to state data, 19 percent of the students have disabilities, higher than the state average. But the proportion of students who come from   families  —   just under 72 percent  —   is lower than in Cleveland, Columbus and Dayton. Close to   of the school's students are white. In a   book in 2002, “The Kids That ECOT Taught,” Mr. Lager wrote that “the dropout rate is the most critical issue facing our public education system but it is only the first of many problems that can be solved by  . ” Through the Electronic Classroom, he wrote, he planned to make public education more efficient and effective. He added, “No business could suffer results that any school in Columbus Public delivers and not be driven out of business. ” Peggy Lehner, a Republican state senator who sponsored a charter school reform bill that passed the legislature last fall, said the problem was the school, not the students. “When you take on a difficult student, you're basically saying, ‘We feel that our model can help this child be successful,' ” she said. “And if you can't help them be successful, at some point you have to say your model isn't working, and if your model is not working, perhaps public dollars shouldn't be going to pay for it. ” Some of those public dollars are being paid to IQ Innovations and Altair Learning Management, companies associated with Mr. Lager. Altair has had a contract with the school since 2000, a school spokesman, Neil Clark, said. According to federal filings, it received $4. 2 million in 2014. Mr. Lager is the company's chief executive. Mr. Clark said Altair provided “a variety of services,” including a program of instruction, strategic planning, public relations, financial reporting and budgeting. In filings with the Ohio secretary of state, Mr. Lager is listed as a registered agent for IQ Innovations in campaign finance records, he was listed as the company's chief executive as recently as 2015. IQ Innovations received $18. 7 million from the school in 2014. Mr. Clark said IQ Innovations had provided the school with grading software and digital curriculum materials since 2008. He said that neither Altair nor IQ Innovations was required to go through a competitive bidding process. At the school's headquarters, in a former mall set at the back of a parking lot here, attendance clerks sit in a windowless room, tracking how often students log in to the network. Those who do not log in for 30 days are reported as truant. Guidance counselors carry caseloads of up to 500 students each, and the schoolwide   ratio is 30 to one. For some students, the Electronic Classroom can provide a release valve from the pressures or frustrations of a traditional school. Several students assembled by the school to talk to a reporter said they had experienced bullying or boredom before enrolling. “Without the bullying, I was able to focus,” said Sydney DeBerry, 20, who left a private school to enroll in the Electronic Classroom, which she graduated from in 2014. “That was a big distraction, not only to my work but to my individuality. ” Students who made it to graduation said   was crucial. “Contrary to popular opinion, you cannot just log on once a week and get by and still pass your classes,” said Dianna Norwood, 19, who graduated last year and is now a student at Ohio State University. But other students complained that the school could make it difficult to succeed. Alliyah Graham, 19, said she had sought out the Electronic Classroom during her junior year because she felt isolated as one of a few   girls at a mostly white public school in a Cincinnati suburb. It took three weeks for the Electronic Classroom to enter her in its system, she said. Then it assigned her to classes she had already passed at her previous school. When she ran into technical problems, she said, “I really just had to wing it. ” Ms. Graham, who hopes to pursue a career in medicine, has also been disappointed by the quality of assignments. She showed a reporter a digital work sheet for a senior English class, in which students were asked to read a passage and then fill in boxes, circles and trapezoids, noting the “main idea,” a “” or “questions you have. ” “I feel like I did this kind of work in middle school,” Ms. Graham said. When she turns in assignments, she said, feedback from teachers is minimal. “Good job!” they write. “Keep going!” She hopes to graduate this spring. Her cousin, Makyla Woods, 19, moved to Cincinnati from Georgia last year, as a senior, to live with her father. Since Ms. Graham was already enrolled in the Electronic Classroom, Ms. Woods decided to give it a try. But she soon moved out from her father's apartment, took a job at McDonald's and stopped doing assignments. “I just got lazy doing work on the computer,” she said.",

         "Halliburton and Baker Hughes Call Off $35 Billion Merger - The New York Times",
         "Leslie Picker",
         "For a year and a half, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, two big oil field services companies, had been focused on their $35 billion merger. That distraction, even as commodity prices deteriorated and their peers cut costs to survive, is finally over. The two companies announced in a statement on Sunday that they had decided to terminate their merger. The news came after an excruciatingly long regulatory review process that culminated in a lawsuit last month by the Justice Department to block the deal on antitrust grounds. “While both companies expected the proposed merger to result in compelling benefits to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders, challenges in obtaining remaining regulatory approvals and general industry conditions that severely damaged deal economics led to the conclusion that termination is the best course of action,” said Dave Lesar, chairman and chief executive of Halliburton, in Sunday's statement. The deal was one that raised eyebrows from the start on whether it would get past regulators. The two companies were seeking to band together to compete with the likes of Schlumberger, and, in the meantime, to erase billions in costs related to operations and research and development. Things changed drastically soon after the deal was signed in November 2014. Oil prices sank to their lowest levels in years, a burden that has affected the entire industry. Sales of assets, which were necessary to appease regulators' concerns that the combination was just too big, suddenly became more challenged.   buyers turned inward to manage their own business during the downturn, and private equity stayed on the sidelines. With the companies' inability to shrink, the Justice Department sued in April to block the deal, saying it would “eliminate vital competition, skew energy markets and harm American consumers. ” That left the companies with little will to fight. “What Halliburton may have miscalculated here is the severity of the downturn and certainly the appetite of the Department of Justice to flex its muscles in a large corporate merger,” said Matt Marietta, an analyst at Stephens Inc. As compensation for the breakup, Halliburton agreed to pay Baker Hughes $3. 5 billion by May 4, according to Sunday's statement. It is a lofty price, especially when cash flow is tight in the energy industry. That high fee was necessary because the deal almost did not happen two years ago. The two companies struggled initially, in the fall of 2014, to find a suitable price and breakup fee. But then, Halliburton threatened to turn over Baker Hughes's board to restart discussions. The plan worked, with Halliburton raising its bid and agreeing to a    fee if the deal were to fail to win regulatory approval. At the time, the fee was a symbolic commitment from Halliburton to do whatever it took to make sure the deal cleared the Justice Department. As   companies, though, analysts say both Halliburton and Baker Hughes should be able to survive. Halliburton has about $10 billion of cash on its balance sheet that it could use toward the breakup fee or potentially other transactions, according to data by SP Capital IQ. “I don't see a risk of either of the companies being bankruptcy risks,” Mr. Marietta said. “I think both companies are well positioned to manage through the downturn. ” Shares of both companies have surged about 20 percent each since the Justice Department's lawsuit was disclosed on April 6. For many investors, the lawsuit was a way of dissipating the cloud of uncertainty that had covered the deal for 18 months. The move by the Justice Department was the latest tough stance from an administration that has been seen as taking more aggressive actions against large deals. The previous one was Pfizer's attempted $152 billion merger with Allergan, which was terminated after the Treasury Department came out with new   rules that eliminated many of the benefits of the deal. The European Commission, the European Union's executive body, also raised concerns about the   Hughes deal. “The transaction raised competition concerns on a very large number of markets related to oil field services provided to oil and gas exploration and production companies” in Europe, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union competition commissioner, said in a statement. She said that “a number of customers contacted us to raise issues with the proposed transaction. ” The date by which Halliburton and Baker Hughes would have to decide whether to continue on their path of regulatory approval or terminate their merger agreement was extended to April 30. As a result, Halliburton postponed its earnings call to Tuesday, which many analysts assumed was done to discuss the deal. Since the downturn started at the end of 2014, Halliburton has reduced its head count by about a third, the company said in its April 22 earnings statement. The company also said it would reduce the infrastructure that it had kept in anticipation of a deal with Baker Hughes. Both companies have experienced significant slumps in revenue and reduced rig counts over the year.",

         "by Tanaaz \nThe October 30th New Moon falls in the dreamy and introspective sign of Scorpio. Even though Scorpio energy can be deep and dark, there is a way to channel this energy into something productive and even, magical. \nThe energy of the October New Moon is going to guide us away from the material and external world and into a deeper, more intuitive realm. Here we will be able to receive new ideas, new inspirations and new creative visions. \nIn fact, the energy of this New Moon has a high creative and supernatural charge to it and we will all be guided to go deep within, so we can remind ourselves about who we really are. \nThere has been a lot of cleansing and releasing energy in the Universe this year, and while October's New Moon will be asking us to go deep, it will be asking us to venture deeper than our problems and deeper than our fears, all the way into the heart of our soul. \nThis New Moon is about reconnecting with who you are, celebrating yourself and learning how to love and accept yourself exactly as you are. \nThere is also a transformative energy to this New Moon, which will be allowing us to emerge reborn. \nThis transformative energy is gentle, supportive and calming. It will be reminding us to nurture and care for ourselves. It will also be reminding us that sometimes the greatest healing we can offer ourselves is our own true love. \nScorpio energy supports us to dive deep into our imagination and intuition. Use the force of this New Moon to travel within and get lost in the fairytales of your mind. Use the energy to inspire your creative visions and to expand your intuition. \nThe New Moon also falls just one day before All Hallows Eve , making the Scorpio New Moon even more magical. \nHalloween is a time when the veil between dimensions is thinnest and this New Moon will definitely be amplifying this energy. \nSpirit energy will be high around this New Moon, so it is important to protect yourself energetically and stay open to any Divine messages or inspiration you may receive. \nIn fact, if there is something that you have been looking to receive guidance on, this New Moon will allow you to take the journey within so you can hear the answer radiating from your own soul. \nThe Scorpio New Moon will also allow us to take a journey into the underworld. \nThe underworld is our subconscious and the deeper, darker, more intuitive side of who we are. It is when we are in this place that we can truly understand the power and magnificence of our own light. \nBy losing our attachment to the external and going deep into the energy of the night, we will be able to realize and feel our potential shining through. \nFor those who already experienced a New Moon on October 1st, this second New Moon will be a Black Moon. \nWhile the energy of the Black Moon is the same, there is a heightened energy when two New Moon's fall in the same month. Those experiencing the Black Moon are going to feel the effects even stronger and will be encouraged to dig that little bit deeper. \nThis digging process is not about assessing, reviewing or analyzing, instead this digging process is about feeling. It is about feeling the soil and the earth around you, it is about feeling who you really are and allowing yourself to get lost in You. \nWe are not our bodies and we are not our thoughts. We are soul energy and when we can travel within to feel this soul energy, we intuitively gain an understanding about who we are and where we are heading. \nIf you allow the energy of the Scorpio New Moon in, you are going to be able to feel your soul; you are going to be able to feel your energy on a powerful level and you are going to be able to transform yourself with the power of your own love. \nThe October New Moon is beautiful, magical and supportive, so allow its energy to guide you. Allow yourself to be taken by the energy and see where you travel to. Share:",

         "BALTIMORE 2016 Bill the eighth \nThis guy is real genius isn't he? He is too stupid to realize all of those tweeter posts and Youtube videos are going to come back and bit him in the rear? Oh well, he will have plenty of time to think about his stupidity while he sits in a jail cell. doodaa \nWould you hire this guy? Lancifer Wildwood \nYou don't need a job when soros the nazi funds you….geesh I don't even live in the US and I know that! Koolz \nJews created Black Lives matter and these guys get paid pretty well for there acting up at any protest. Black Lives Matter the very name creates violence. Purple lives Matter Hunter \nBingo!!! \nYou know, I wonder if / when “somebody in the know”, were to release nasty-jew George Soro's travel itinerary…to the “right people”… \n…hey Georgie…watch-out…payback can be a BITCH Zone43 \n50 Rabbis marched with them in Ferguson. owr \nJews are truly racist. M Saurette \nso, the plan is to be more violent, more racist, more destructive. And the goal is to have blacks NOT be targeted by police? Good luck with that. owr \nIt won't just be the police targeting rioting blacks.The average white is ready fearfully cautious of black thugs. The thugs know this and they try to intimidate whites by flaunting theirs MTV image of the ‘Gangsta' by learning the right facial expressions, and wearing their pants on their ass. Stacking gang signs, even if not in a gang to appear knowledgeable about such things. It might work with some of the girls, but to the average young white male it is perceived as a potential threat. The primary difference between white males and black males is that only 30%, on average, black males are not convicted felons, and cannot legally possess a firearm. On the other hand nearly 80% of white males have no felony conviction, and can, or do possess legal firearms. Blacks are 13% of our population. Whites are a little under 70%. There are also a huge number of pissed off white veterans of Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, who would not mind a little domestic house cleaning. You can bet your ass, and not be afraid of losing it, that these Vets are Trump supporters. Be careful what you wish for. The real world is not MTV, or a gangsta movie. Cornczech \nThis morning on my walk to the Howard Redline stop in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago, IL…..I was called out to by a black woman: “Hey, F* YOU, White B#tch!” The sad part, because I had to stop acting and looking scared a few years back when I first MOVED to this hood, (sometime after Obama became King), is that I am USED to this kind of thing, so I started to giggle after that outburst…yes, the abuse got worse …but…I get this at least once a week when I walk to the store, to the EL….to the bank……so (shrug). \nI have never called a black man or woman a nigger…(I bet I get blasted or removed or censored for that…but I get called whitey, hillbilly…(I'm a Cracker, let's get THAT straight!), and a myriad of other race specific names…..I have even been assaulted for being white and standing up for myself…(I am a female, by the way….so, I have OTHER stories about my lovely experience living in CHICAGO…the next Detroit….) \nSo how am I a racist? I grew up in Texas and never had problems or saw violence..or had violence perpetrated against me…..since I came here… \nSo tell me again how I am a racist? \nMy LAST question is: WHEN DID AMERICA come to such a SAD STATE? owr \nMy suggestion is to get out of Chicago, it will be a pure hell-hole in the coming depression. Go back to Texas, the economy is much better there, and race relations are as well. Ted Dura \noh joy Trump to dump 40 million mexicans and open season on rioting niggas-See its True ! \nTRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !! Guillotine_ready \nWhy wait? Burn your houses down now!! doodaa \nAnd your liquer store! GORDON \nSheesh can we all just get along , we've seen how well having a black president worked out ? Thank God I live where it's cold and the black populous is to a minimal ! Thank God all you do is kill each other anyway ! \nWill the HUMAN RACE ever grow up? Sheesh! This is so stupid. Does a Siamese cat hate the Prussian Blue because it's a different ‘breed'? Does and Irish Setter hate the Black Lab because. . . \nMan, people are the most un-evolved, unreasonable. . . doodaa \nUnfortunately, this has been going on since humans became self aware. Will we ever evolve? Not in our genes. Jo Peter \nActually the ‘good fences make good neighbors' tendency toward self segregation followed by more or less peaceful voluntary trade appears more or less universal, and it's only the radical liberal cultural Marxism nonesense that is making this unworkable in the west (and this is mostly to blame on the mechanations of one particular tribe that's ‘white' when it benefits them but who hold no actual allegiance to the white race, we all know who they are.) doodaa \nDo you think maybe “GOD” knew what he was doing when he segregated races by continents? Jo Peter \nThat is certainly a valid way to look at it. Some people view the order of the universe as through an impersonal ‘nature' force, and others consider it a conscious design by an intelligent creator. In the end there is little practical difference when it comes to the specifics like this, since either way it worked before we broke it. \nWell, some of us are OK. I've dated outside my race, and I miss my buds of the past who I spent time with who weren't fellow ‘honky-gringo-crackers'. fujak \ntypical….blacks want democracy but only if and when it suits them woody \nThis country needs a good cleansing, bring it on brotha! Bruce Regael \nWe need LA Riots everywhere with police standing down. I'd love for them to bring the riots to the nice white liberal neighborhoods where those agent provocateurs riling up minorities always tend to hide after they fan the flames. If anyone needs to pay its white liberals. They've been playing puppet master for far too long using racial politics against conservative white people. \nTime is coming where we're going to have to put the boots to their throats or force the minorities to kick their teeth in. doodaa \nBlack folks will be OK. There is no bag limit on dumb niggers. Jo Peter \nIndeed. The ones that long ago accepted the cultural superiority of the west are allies. They can't choose what genes they're born with but they can side with good against radical liberal insanity. doodaa Zaphod Braden \nAMEN !!! Sanders was born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and graduated from the University of CHICAGO in 1964. While a student, he was an active civil rights protest organizer for the CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY and STUDENT (not really)NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE. Bernie ran to Vermont in 1968, to get away from BLACKS to raise HIS family in SAFETY Sanders switched PARTIES, BETRAYED the Veterans, and instigates the Blacks and then RUNS AWAY. In January 1962, Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. “We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,” Sanders said at the protest. But then Sanders ran to SAFE LILLY WHITE VERMONT to raise HIS children far away from those Blacks he wants you to live with. doodaa Cindyejohnson1 “my .friend's mate Is getting 98$.

Jones \nThis is the classic ” lets get dumb ass to do the dirty work for us” trick. This dude is being played by the same people who will drop his ass on the street when theyre done with him. Inciting race wars and turning people against each other. This dude is a total looser. The only rapping he should do is with some tape around his flappy mouth. Someone give this dude a hug and ask him if hes making the world a better place by being a dick. Jolly Roger \nThis moron is just a tool, paid by rich people to incite racial tensions, with the usual hollow threats designed to intimidate white people as part of their ongoing divide-and-conquer agenda. \n“We don't want to work. We don't want to go to school. We demand to be handed everything we want, and if we don't get it, we'll attack white people.” \nShut up, you idiot, and go back to your zoo. \nNo intelligent debate. No civilized discussion. Just a gang of RACIST thugs trying to intimidate people based on their skin color. Tell me more about “equality”. \nI hate to participate, or even respond to a racist tirade, but these Soros-funded useful idiots may make it necessary. Just be ready to mow 'em down along with the wetbacks, just in case they make that necessary. doodaa \nNigga' just might get his ass shot. L Garou \nIs that an admission of retardation, or shall we produce his test scores to prove it? doodaa \nI thought all lives mattered until this dumb nigger started talking. Now I wonder. owr \nThey are being programmed by George Soros to be agent provocateurs to create racial tension to allow for martial law to occur in order to keep the establishment as is. Clinton will insure this if elected. 8s5s5 \nTo help payoff my student-loans I worked as a NYC teacher in “troubled” neighborhoods for ten years. During those ten years I saw delinquents call each other “niggas” hundreds of times every single school day. If I had done it once, I would have been fired that same day. They punched each other, stole from each other, and from the faculty, vandalized the school, threw brand new text books out the window but the state and federal funds continued to pour in, very much contrary to popular belief. \nThey actually got more money then the nicer areas. When I was finally able to move to a “good” school district, I couldn't believe it. When I told the children (99% Caucasians) to take a a book and read quietly they actually did it. No exaggeration, you good actually hear your own respiration, that's how quiet it was!!! And yes, you can find some schools with 95-99% white student population. I was never a “racist” but this was too much. The difference is incredible!!! Unfortunately if you notice a obvious behavioral difference between races, you are labeled as some kind of a bad person and the general public has learned to accept this word “racist” as derogatory regardless of the evidences that may exist, and we all know that they do exist. This denial has successfully forced illogical integration, the destruction of our liberty and country and the rise of economic fascist billionaires. Donald Trump, the only billionaire to go against is fellow elites is being completely typecast as “the rich white guy that must be a racist.” He is probably the one and only chance the middle class and the poor class will ever see again for justice in this country. The last man to have had his courage was President JFK. owr \nTo actually be a nigger, one must learn to be one. They have plenty of role models to copy. It's a matter of choice. nobody \nLol… what a dumb ass! It'll be a hoot watching video of these “tough” guys(gals?) getting their butts whomped after they destroy mostly their own slums, and if we're lucky a few other choice places. desertspeaks \n“we will incite riots everywhere if trump wins” translation, we know if trump wins, we'll have to get jobs to pay rent, food etc. and being societal parasites, we don't want actual jobs, just free shit! owr \nCulture is learned in the home, and in school. “Granny was on total entitlements, so was momma, so is sista, so is my daddy where-ever and who-ever he is. So why I has ta lern all this white shit in school, I quit when I'm 16 and be worken the streets, the man..he be givn me food-stamps evey month that I can sell fo beer and cigarettes. Man, we got it fucken made.” Zone43 \nThey will stay in the cities, cry baby's. Strayhorse \nWhat government really fears is when other than people of color, were to take to the streets. That's why the government and the controlled media hide the truth about crime, racist crime perpetrated against other than people of color. When other than people of color awakens to the truth about crimes against them, L.A., Ferguson, and riots of their kind would pale against the response levied against the government for allowing the crimes against other than people of color to continue as it does today. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 DOES NOT offer any protection for other than people of color. That's NOT was it was passed for! Other than people of color have NO federal or state protections against prejudice, injustice and inequality. nightwisp \nThe 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 made their rights equal to the white man. If the white man is gone, they are equal to nothing. They will have no rights. owr \nWe are all slaves to the corporations, debt slaves. owr \nThat is precisely why the libs began the fake and un-natural PC agenda, to erode the 1st amendment. Raymond McGraw \nYou are surely as you called it…“NIGGA'S.Does not make a hill of difference who.what where or why.You were just born to riot.You have failed to look at the true one who has enlslaved you the last 8 years in the liberals and there government.Now you have become pawns working for them.Of course you have not realized that either.When the true one wins this and he will. You can then say Gee! Mr .Trump wished I had listened to you. D Urge \nHe's right WE have been too nice. \nTRUMP 2016 Lancifer Wildwood \nI'm not sure this person of colour knows what he/they (whatever the frick) are up against if it comes down to it? The inner city shit holes they are seemingly incapable of building up into prospering neighbourhoods are NOT the rest of the US from my travels there. nightwisp \n* YAWN * please pass the popcorn… Josephine Dorion \nNO, THE WHITES AIN'T SCAYRED OF YAH. BE PREPARED TO BE EXTERMINATED. Ed Troyer \nI see bulldozers, flame throwers…. jake \nwow, doesn't this show how clueless, americans trully are. almost makes one want to tell the trump campaign how to beat the voting fix. where are these guys and gals going to wreak havoc? in the cities where unarmed gay and mainly democrats live, black people, spanish, and poor people in general. poop where you eat, that is a controlled serf. show how your an oreo banker slave. when you get to the rural areas, the black, white, and spanish, rural people will be waiting. you won't stand a chance, against the unified rural people. after following the banking oversears orders, to destroy yourself and your families based on unknown fears, do you think you'll be going to valhalla, for following the bloodcults, marching orders, to divide and conquer. killing people who don't have any more say than yourself, because a banker said it was so, priceless. Michael \nThat would be instant death for the 3/5th's, 14th amendment black United States citizens. This country was created by old white men to protect the white race. This is why the Jewish run media are promoting the blacks to riot. In fact black folks if your going to go after a group you might want to think about going after the Jews in the media. As they're the one's that have set you up to fail. Here's a sweet piece of history the majority of the Negroes don't know. Israel Cohen, the General Secretary of the World Zionist Organization, in his 1912 book “A racial program for the 20th Century”. And, read into the Congressional Record by Congressman Thomas Abernathy, U.S. House of Representatives Mississippi, 4th District on June 7, 1957, Volume 103, top of page 8559: Israel Cohen penned “We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tension. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites, we can mould them to the program of Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.” So black folks before you embark on a suicide mission learn some real history and the true cause of your plight. As your anger is miss directed and you will be engaged as belligerents and enemy combatants. Live in peace, be well, and do your homework before you attempt something rash and dangerous. Rick \nIt's coon hunting season once again! Allan Munroe \nI don't know what color you are but I do know you are a Fucking Nigger ,,,soon you will know what it feels to be without hope just as I felt since you Voted into office That Fucking Ass Kissing Brother of the Muslim Brotherhood , who did all he could do except suck the Dick of the King of Saudi Arabia on National T.V. , all while trying to completely destroy USA but he didn't learn enough in school regarding the Constitution of the USA. Soon Mr. Trump will be writing down names & kicking ASS ———-Niger Clean Kut \nNot only do Trumpets have the tactical military training, and are stockpiling ammo, bombs, grenades and other weapons… They've been WAITING FOR THE DAY they can legally open fire on blacks and liberals for DECADES. They are SO ready… Trump says he will pay their legal fees and they feel emboldened.? det0918 \nWhat a loser ….he is what you get when raise your children with violence, hit, beat and threaten your children, you get violent minds…who see no other way but to threaten other people and perpetrate on them what was done to them by their own parents- yes, it's white people's fault your life sucks. \n…amazing how many blacks are able to live life like the rest of us…in peace…. but you can't manage it …so it must be someone else's fault …who do white people blame when their lives suck? C.A.Martin \nWell Poe just remember there are ten times as many whites (many well armed) as blacks and your not exactly on good terms with the Hispanics as well. Self immolation is just not a good way to go. But go for it, burn baby burn. Maus \nThey will destroy America one liquor store, one Best Buy and one Footlocker at a time! Zaphod Braden \nThat nigga is the PROPERTY of George Soros. Zaphod Braden \nThis moron should go visit Bernie Sanders —— in VERMONT Sanders was born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and graduated from the University of CHICAGO in 1964. While a student, he was an active civil rights protest organizer for the CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY and STUDENT (not really)NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE.

But then Sanders ran to SAFE LILLY WHITE VERMONT to raise HIS children far away from those Blacks he wants you to live with. Zaphod Braden \nHe just qualified — as a DOMESTIC TERRORIST: Hussein Obama claims Congress “must do it's Constitutional DUTY” by accepting his nominee, but Hussein REFUSES to do HIS Constitutional DUTY of evicting illegal invaders and securing OUR borders “during a time of war on terror”. Hussein is the Chief Executive. Hussein's PRIMARY CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY is to enforce the laws, yet he REFUSES to do so. \n“our” politicians take oaths to uphold the LAW and the Constitution. When they REFUSE to, when they openly DEFY and circumvent the LAW, they FORFEIT their “Governmental Immunity”. Every Politician who goes on record as supporting ILLEGAL INVADERS should be held financially responsible for PAYING REPARATIONS for the crimes done by the ILLEGALS. Start CIVIL FORFEITURE on the assets of Politicians that cover for ILLEGAL INVADERS. RESOURCES",

         "Sean Adl-Tabatabai",
         "Posted on October 27, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in Middle East , News // 0 Comments \nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry have urged The International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute the Israeli army after they confessed to “field executions” against Palestinians. \nThe Ministry made the comments after a leaked Israeli army report admitted it was possible to avoid firing against Palestinian people. \nXinhuanet.com reports: \n“The leaking of an Israeli army internal memo is meant to distort the work of the ICC and its preliminary investigations with regards to Israeli crimes including field executions in order to claim that the occupation authorities are undergoing due procedures with regards to such crimes,” the ministry said in a statement. \nThe ministry said that although the report mentions four cases, it “ignores the fact that all cases of field executions that claimed the lives of dozens of Palestinians did not impose any serious harm or life threat to soldiers.” \nIsraeli public radio reported early on Tuesday that an internal report was dispatched to army soldiers saying that it was possible to avoid shooting Palestinians in the West Bank in four separate incident if the army forces acted in a proper way during those incidents. \nThe report added that two Palestinians were killed in those incidents and two others were critically injured, pointing out that soldiers opened fire towards them while they should have not, and that if they had acted differently in some cases, they would have avoided shooting them. \nA wave of tensions has been flaring between Israel and the Palestinians in the Palestinian territories since October 2015. \nOfficial figures say at least 226 Palestinians and 40 Israeli were killed. \nTension between the two ides mounted and went on on daily basis following the daily assaults on Jerusalem by Israeli settlers and security forces, besides the repeated attempts of radical Jewish groups to get into Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.",

         "The Cannon Ball Saga: An Epic Story From The American Heartland",
         null,
         "License DMCA \nThere is an epic clash of two cultures -- one with a guiding ethic of harmony between people and nature, the other driven by an ethos that encourages the exploitation of both. Yet, for months, our clueless media gave this match-up little coverage. \nFor the face-off is between Energy Transfer Partners, one of the world's largest pipeline corporations, and the Standing Rock Lakota Sioux Tribe. It's not merely big news, but the panoramic story of America itself. It's a real reality show -- a cultural, political and moral drama featuring raw greed, grassroots courage, class war, ancient rites, human rights, defenders of the common good, the most nefarious Texas oilman since J. R. Ewing, a historic gathering of Native tribes and a Bull-Connor-style sheriff -- all on location near a North Dakota town named Cannon Ball! \nThe Dakota Access Pipeline is a massive 1,172-mile-long pipeline being constructed by EPT. It will cut through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. This pipeline, owned by oilman Kelcy Warren, crosses 200 rivers and countless farms, and it cuts through the ancestral lands and burial grounds of the Tribe. \nDAPL risks economic and environmental disaster. The corporation plans to bury its oil pipeline under the Missouri, beneath the Lakota people's main source of water for drinking, bathing, irrigation, fishing, and recreation. As a Lakota phrase says -- water is life -- and one rupture could be ruinous. \nIn April, the Standing Rock Sioux made their stand. Some 35 tribal leaders established Sacred Stone Camp, just off their reservation and near where ETP's engineers intend to tunnel under the river. After the tribe's social media network spread word of the rebellion, a spontaneous migration of Native people -- not coordinated by anyone -- began arriving at the camp to stand in solidarity against ETP. - Advertisement - \nThey came in cars, campers, and caravans -- some even paddled down the Missouri in traditional canoes. By August, representatives of 280 Native American tribes had joined, making this the largest, most diverse, cross-tribal action in U.S. history. Sacred Stone Camp pulsated with a sense of rediscovered power, ancestral duty, and indigenous culture. Not only were spirits high, but the extraordinary unity of so many diverse Native cultures -- boldly gathering in a show of strength and shouting \"NO\" to yet another arrogant act of gross injustice -- seemed to herald a reawakening. \nAs the protest gained strength -- and was joined by thousands of progressives and covered by independent media -- ETP and its political minions responded predictably: with panic, whining, lies, and brute force. \nNorth Dakota's governor, Jack Dalrymple falsely wailed that \"unlawful acts associated with the protest near Cannon Ball have led to serious public safety concerns and property damage.\" He declared a state of emergency, set up road blocks to seal off the reservation, brought in riot-clad troopers, removed state water and health services from the protest area, and used his state PR machine to demonize the activists as a violent threat to surrounding towns of white people. \nETP's legal beagles have attempted to silence protesters by filing hokey lawsuits against several tribal leaders and activists that may be aimed at bankrupting defendants with legal fees; seeking a federal injunction against anyone interfering with pipeline construction; and threatening to prosecute Native Americans for -- Oh, the irony! -- trespassing on land that was theirs before it was stolen from them. \nOn Labor Day weekend, a DAPL crew suddenly started construction on the under-river tunnel, reportedly damaging tribal burial sites. When unarmed protesters put their bodies in front of the machinery, a line of private \"pipeline guards\" showed up and blasted at least 30 protesters with pepper spray and sicced a pack of attack dogs on them. At least six people were bitten, including a child and a pregnant woman. - Advertisement - \nAt least four reporters have been charged with everything from criminal trespass to conspiracy for trying to cover what the mainstream media won't touch. Charges are still pending for some of these journalists. \nStanding Rock tribe's chair, Dave Archambault has made clear that the Native people are committed to the higher values of \"our lands, people, water, and sacred sites.\" As they have been for millennia, the tribe's actions today must be based on the common good of their grandchildren and their grandchildren-generations into the future. The Standing Rock Sioux are in this fight for the long haul: \"Our fight isn't over until there is permanent protection of our people and resources from the pipeline. We won't stop until they [EPT] stop.\" To find out more and join the fight, go to www.SacredStoneCamp.org .",

         "You are here: Home / political cartoon / Why Polls Showing Hillary in The Lead Are Useless And Misleading [CARTOON] Why Polls Showing Hillary in The Lead Are Useless And Misleading [CARTOON] October 29, 2016 Pinterest \nRobert Gehl reports that with less than ten days to go, Donald Trump appears to be surging with likely voters across the country. \nDespite an onslaught of negative coverage from all corners of the media, the Republican Presidential candidate has gained on Hillary Clinton in the latest poll from The Washington Post and ABC News. \nHillary still holds a 48-44 percent edge over Trump, but that is up from 38 percent support for Trump in the last week alone, fueled by support is shoring up among political independents and hard-core Republicans. He has made up ground among white people - with a 30-point advantage among whites without a college degree, up from a 20 point advantage. \nTrump saw his biggest gains among political independents, favoring Trump by a 12-point margin in the latest tracking poll, 49 to 37 percent, after giving Clinton a narrow edge in late last week. Neither candidate has maintained a consistent lead among independent likely voters in Post-ABC polling this fall. \nDespite the surge in Trump's popularity, still six in ten voters expect Hillary Clinton to win anyway. The same poll found that only 30 percent thought Donald Trump would prevail. This plays into the Trump narrative that the vote is somehow “rigged” in favor of Clinton and no matter how much support he has, Trump would never ascend to the presidency. \nSizable minorities of likely voters express concerns about fraud and inaccuracy at the ballot box, though worries about both have declined in the past month. Fewer than four in 10 voters now say voter fraud occurs very or somewhat often (37 percent), down from 47 percent in early September. Studies of voter fraud have found that it is very rare. \nIn a separate question, the share of voters saying they do not have confidence votes will be counted accurately dipped from 33 to 28 percent, while the percentage saying they are “very confident” rose from 31 to 43 percent. \nSeven in 10 Trump supporters say voter fraud occurs at least somewhat often, including 34 percent who think it happens “very often.” And Trump voters are split on whether votes will be counted accurately across the country, with 50 percent at least somewhat confident and 49 percent “not too” or “not at all” confident. \nWhile Trump voters' concerns about fraud and vote counting have not changed significantly since last month, Clinton supporters expressed growing confidence in the election process. The share of Democrats who are “very confident” the vote will be accurately counted has grown from 45 percent last month to 70 percent in the new Post-ABC poll. And while more than 1 in 5 Democrats last month thought voter fraud occurs at least somewhat often, that has fallen to slightly more than 1 in 10 in this week's poll. \nThe poll was conducted with a sampling of 1,775 adults and has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.5 percentage points.",

         "6 More State Workers Charged in Flint Water Crisis - The New York Times",
         "Amy Haimerl and Abby Goodnough",
         "FLINT, Mich.  —   State prosecutors filed criminal charges against six more government workers here on Friday in connection with Flint's water contamination crisis, accusing them of concealing urgent information about the lead that was leaching into the city's drinking water and doing nothing to stop it. The charges bring to nine the number of public employees criminally charged in the public health crisis, all midlevel bureaucrats or lower. Flint residents have been outraged that   officials have so far escaped any consequences. But the Michigan attorney general, Bill Schuette, hinted at a news conference on Friday that charges against   officials might follow, saying that investigators were “moving up the chain” and “going where the truth takes us, period. ” The widening inquiry comes as Flint's residents continue to cope with the effects of the contamination. Concerns about the water emerged more than two years ago, but residents' complaints were brushed off until last fall, when Gov. Rick Snyder acknowledged the scope of the problem. Tests continue to show that unfiltered tap water is still not safe to drink, and public health workers are trying to monitor thousands of Flint children who may have been exposed to high levels of lead, which can profoundly affect growth, behavior and intelligence over time. Mr. Schuette said the employees charged Friday  —   three from Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services and three from its Department of Environmental Quality  —   all “attempted to bury or cover up, to downplay or hide information” about the lead contamination that began in April 2014, when Flint began using the Flint River as its water supply to save money. “Their story was, there is nothing wrong with Flint water and it was perfectly safe to use,” said Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018. “In essence, these individuals concealed the truth. They were criminally wrong to do so. ” The accused include Liane Shekter Smith, who led the state environmental agency's Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit until she was fired in February. Prosecutors said she withheld information about the severe health risks of using the water after the lead contamination was underway and failed to protect the citizens of Flint. She was charged with one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, and one count of willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor. The other Department of Environmental Quality employees charged were Adam Rosenthal, a water regulator who prosecutors said doctored reports about lead levels in Flint's water, and Patrick Cook, another regulator they said misled officials with the federal Environmental Protection Agency about the city's water quality. Both men were charged with misconduct in office and conspiracy. Mr. Cook was also charged with willful neglect of duty, and Mr. Rosenthal with tampering with evidence. Also charged were Nancy Peeler, the Early Childhood Health Section manager in the state's Department of Health and Human Services Robert Scott, a data analyst for the department and Corinne Miller, a state epidemiologist. Prosecutors said the three employees learned last July of a spike in the number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels but concealed the results. After seeing an internal report showing the increase, Mr. Schuette said, Ms. Peeler and Mr. Scott “produced a bogus report” that showed no worrisome rise in lead levels. Ms. Miller, who was the state's top epidemiologist but has since left the job, instructed others not to take action on the initial report, Mr. Schuette said. The three are charged with one count each of misconduct in office, conspiracy and willful neglect of duty. The four employees charged Friday who were still working for the state were suspended without pay. Todd Flood, the special counsel for the investigation, noted that on the same day that the health officials learned about the spike in blood lead levels, July 28 of last year, the environmental officials charged were doctoring water quality reports, and he hinted at a broader conspiracy. “You have two agencies manipulating reports on the same day,” Mr. Flood said, “and that lock step, going to stage left, that seems significant to me. ” Mr. Schuette, who said last month that investigators were having trouble getting documents they had requested from Governor Snyder's private lawyers, said they had since had “great constructive dialogue” with Mr. Snyder's team. The investigators refused to say whether they had interviewed Mr. Snyder, but one, Andrew Arena, said, “Nobody's off limits, and the facts will take us to the truth. ” He likened the investigation to an organized crime case, which starts with   people with the expectation that they can lead them to those at the top. “You don't start at the top with organized crime,” Mr. Arena said. “That's what we're doing here. ” Flint began using the Flint River as its water supply to save money, but state regulators failed to require the city to add chemicals to prevent pipe corrosion, causing lead to leach into the water system. Brian P. Morley, a lawyer for Ms. Shekter Smith, said he was “surprised at these charges” and expected his client to plead not guilty. A lawyer for Ms. Miller declined to comment other defendants did not immediately return calls. Two other state employees and a Flint municipal employee  —   Michael Prysby, a district engineer with the environmental quality department, Stephen Busch, a district supervisor in the same department, and Michael Glasgow, Flint's utilities manager  —   were charged in April in connection with the lead contamination. Mr. Glasgow has since agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for reduced charges. A report last month from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that children drinking Flint water had a nearly 50 percent higher chance of elevated blood lead levels during the   period that the city was using river water. A local pediatrician, Dr. Mona   completed her own study in September 2015 and was the first to publicly warn of the spike in lead levels. The investigators said they were also investigating a possible connection between the water contamination and an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that sickened at least 87 people in the Flint region, with nine known deaths, from June 2014 through October 2015. “You can rest assured that that is on our radar every day,” Mr. Flood said. “That is an investigation that is ongoing, and we have the best experts in the world working with us. ”",

         "Three Ways to Recharge Your Energy Using Crystals",
         "stevew",
         "by Tanaaz \nCrystals are a great tool for healing, awakening and raising your vibration. When I first started out on my spiritual journey it took me a while to truly appreciate the power of a crystal. \nWhen you find a crystal that really resonates with you and that you feel really attracted to, you know you have found the right one. \nFor years, I chose crystals based on the written metaphysical properties and for some reason they always felt “off” to me. When I started choosing crystals based on feeling alone, that is when I truly noticed their amazing abilities. \nCrystals contain a powerful energy for helping you to recharge your own vibration and connection to Spirit. \nHere are 3 ways to use your crystals to recharge: Mind, Body, Spirit Recharge \nPerfect for an all-over recharge for your energy, best done just before bed. \n1.) Choose 3 crystals that resonate with you- one for your mind, one for your body and one for your spirit. Make sure your crystals are cleansed. \n2.) Hold the physical body crystal in your hand and set your intention into the stone. Whisper what outcome or feeling you would like to create in your physical body. Hold the stone close to you as you repeat and feel your intention. Repeat this process for the mind and spirit crystals as well. \n3.) After setting your intention into your crystals, sleep with them under your pillow or by your bedside. \n4.) Keep your crystals close to you whenever you need an energy recharge. Positive Energy Recharge \nPerfect for recharging your energy after being around a negative person or situation. \n1.) Choose 2 powerful, cleansed crystals that resonate with you and place them in each hand. Gently close your hand around the crystals and breathe. \n2.) As your breathe feel the energy of the crystal moving up through your arms and travelling around your entire body. Feel the beautiful, vibes of the crystal cleansing and clearing your aura and energy. \n3.) Keep breathing through the cleansing until the energy of the crystal has travelled to every part of your body. \n4.) Cleanse your crystals if needed after you are done. Self- Empowerment Chakra Recharge \nPerfect for when you are lacking confidence in yourself. \n1.) Choose one crystal that resonates with you and place it out to be charged in the sunlight for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can choose 7 crystals - one for each chakra. \n2.) Once the crystal has been charged, start rubbing it between your hands to generate heat and more energy. \n3.) When you feel the heat or charge of the crystal, place your hands over your root chakra or pelvis area (touch your skin not your clothes). Allow the energy to sink in to this area of your body. \n4.) When you feel the energy has gone in, rub the crystal again and place it on your next chakra. Keep repeating this process until you have done all 7 chakras. \nHappy recharging!",

         "Gorka on Syria: ‘No Endgame That Involves Us Being Global Police Officer'",
         "John Hayward",
         "Dr. Sebastian Gorka, former Breitbart News National Security editor and current deputy assistant to President Trump, discussed Syria policy on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Daily. [SiriusXM host Alex Marlow suggested there were too many conflicting statements coming from various Trump administration officials about Syria, but Gorka insisted “we have absolute clarity. ”  “You just have to listen to the president, the  ” he advised. “He has been explicit, and nothing has changed from November the 8th to today. ” “We sent a very clear message concerning the use of weapons of mass destruction against women and children, but the president has said we have no interest in invading other people's countries and occupying them. This isn't the Bush administration of 2003, nor is it the first Gulf War of 1991. These things are very, very clear,” Gorka asserted. Marlow countered by playing a clip of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeming to endorse regime change in Syria. “I think it's clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Tillerson declared. Gorka said it was “not a binary proposition” to call for regime change without also committing the United States to a military intervention. “Nothing that Secretary Tillerson said has anything to do with an invasion or forced removal of Assad. Nothing,” he said. “Everybody's on the same sheet of music, whether it's the Secretary of State, whether it's Secretary Mattis, whether it's General McMaster the National Security Adviser. They all follow the lead of the   . ”  “There's more than one way  —   there are dozens of different ways that one individual can step down from power. He doesn't have to be removed,” Gorka argued. “That's why the action we took last Thursday was so seminal. We sent a message to the sponsors of this regime. ” “Remember this is a satrapy, it's a client state of other nations,” he explained. “The message we sent is, there is a point at which an individual like Assad, when he does things as heinous as using chemical weapons against unarmed women and children, the   analysis for his sponsors  —   Moscow included  —   has to be reassessed. ”  “When that is reassessed, if he loses the sponsorship of places like the Kremlin, it becomes much easier for him to be forced out of office politically, not by force, because he simply loses the confidence of his supporters and also the people around him. Remember, Alex, Assad is just one man. He doesn't have to be removed through force. He can be removed politically. We went a great distance towards that political resolution by the actions we took last week,” said Gorka. Marlow noted that much of President Trump's voting base was “not expecting him to proactively get involved in foreign entanglements that did not directly impact the national security of America. ” “Number One, this did impact our national security directly,” Gorka responded. “Whether you live in San Bernardino, Boston, or whether you live anywhere else in the United States, the idea that you have the free use of chemical weapons in a war zone  —   where ISIS, our primary threat, is recruiting, is functioning, can access those weapons  —   that is a primary threat to the United States. ” “Secondly, this isn't a ‘foreign entanglement' in the way that our Founding Fathers described it,” he continued. “I say to your listeners, and this is a very important question  —   I understand the concerns, but really the people who voted for the president should not be concerned. ”  “Just compare the difference between two things: the invasion of 150, 160 thousand soldiers and Marines into a given theater, whether it's Gulf I, whether it's 2003  —   compare that please to the launching of 59 vehicles from the Med, from a ship in absolute safety, targeting one airfield used to launch those weapons,” he urged. “These two things are incomparable, and let's have a little bit of sophistication in our analysis. One does not lead to the other. ” Marlow mentioned fears that even if American military actions remain as limited and   as Gorka described, there was still a danger we could be pressed into service as “the world's policeman,” with an enormous number of atrocities around the world demanding our attention. “There is no intent, no desire, no endgame that involves us being a global police officer. Absolutely not,” Gorka replied. “With regard to the awful things that happen in mass numbers every day around the world, we have a different perspective,” he continued. “It's not the last eight years, when the Obama administration looked at the world as it would like it to be, as opposed to how it is. This president is a pragmatist. You don't get to be the most successful real estate mogul in New York, the toughest market in America, for 40 years unless you are a pragmatist. ” “We are interested in the overlap between moral imperative and national security. Strategy is exactly like politics: it is the art of the possible. We take action not because there is a global interest we take action because there is a national security interest, which sometimes may overlap with the global interest with regard to human rights or the use of chemical weapons,” Gorka said.  “The primary driving metric for everything the president does, because this is his primary mission, is the safety of the American people. In this case, this has nothing to do with being a globocop. This has to do with ISIS in theater, weapons of mass destruction, and the stability of the Middle East,” he stressed. Marlow said the Trump voting base was also wary of increased tensions with Russia, and was hoping the Russians could prove useful in defeating the Islamic State once and for all. He asked if the increasingly adversarial relationship between Presidents Trump and Putin was a response to “CNN conspiracy theories” about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Gorka responded by emphasizing Trump's instincts as a pragmatist.  “The statements coming out of Moscow should not be taken at face value. Remember who Putin was. Remember what this regime has done in the last 12 years,” he added. Gorka quoted Trump's response to a question at a press conference about relations with Russia: “I would like, if possible, to have good relations with Moscow. Right now, it doesn't really seem like that's possible. If that's the case, so be it. ” “We do not make the national security interests of the United States hostage to other people's opinions and propaganda,” he declared. “As a result, the president will keep his course. ” Marlow brought up White House spokesman Sean Spicer's   gaffe comparing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to Adolf Hitler, and said he hoped no one in the White House seriously thought Assad was in a league with Hitler. “Of course not,” Gorka replied. “Let's close down the conspiracy theories. ” Marlow said it would not be easy to make the Left take that advice, because they are in “total meltdown over this, hysteria mode, even accusing him of Holocaust denial. ” “I'm used to it. This is what we've been living with for 12 weeks now: the absolutely   absurd fixation on   short little clips of interviews taken out of context to spin up fake news,” Gorka sighed. “Everybody knows that Sean misspoke, and he stated so,” he continued. “I want to say one thing to my colleague Sean, and everybody I think knows this: outside of the Oval Office, Sean Spicer is a great patriot, a great American, probably has the toughest job in America. If you offered me that job, I wouldn't take it with a gun to my head. We have to recognize his professionalism. Sometimes you stumble, and he did yesterday, but he's made up for it. Let's move on. ” Turning to North Korea, Gorka reiterated his   determination not to “give away the playbook” on strategy, but allowed that there was a “similar dynamic” with North Korea and Syria. “North Korea doesn't function without sponsorship, and we know who sponsors it,” he elaborated. “We are reasserting American leadership in the world. We're filling the vacuum created by the last administration everywhere, including in Asia. ”  “I'll simply put it this way: our actions are a forceful expression of our intent to provide leadership in the world and stability. We have    actors. North Korea is one of them. Our actions send a very clear message to those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea, that they too  —   like Russia with regard to Syria  —   have to reassess their   analysis, and the calculation of how long they should support regimes like North Korea. Because North Korea is a destabilizing factor for all the nations of the region, and is a threat. That's the message we're sending,” said Gorka.

         "Angelina Jolie to Divorce Brad Pitt, Ending ‘Brangelina' - The New York Times",
         "Valeriya Safronova",
         "It was a grand Hollywood romance that made its presence felt far and wide, from the red carpet to refugee camps in the world's trouble spots. It was chronicled in lavish photo spreads in   fashion magazines and in paparazzi shots that appeared in the tabloids and on the gossip sites, as if to undercut the couple's mythic status. Now, with a lawyer's blandly worded press statement on Tuesday morning, the love story of Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt, who were married in 2014, has come to an unhappy end. “This decision was made for the health of the family,” Robert Offer, a lawyer for Ms. Jolie Pitt, said in the statement. “She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time. ” The announcement came a little over two years after the couple married in a ceremony before roughly 20 friends and family members in a Romanesque chapel on the grounds of Château Miraval, their estate in the south of France. The couple's six children, three of them adopted, attended the bride and groom. The master tailor Luigi Massi of Atelier Versace made Ms. Jolie Pitt's wedding dress, incorporating designs from her children's drawings. In keeping with the public nature of their relationship, Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie Pitt sold the photographs of their wedding day to People and Hello! magazines for a reported $5 million. In keeping with their habit of giving to charity, the couple contributed the payment to the   Foundation. When their romance became public, the tabloids were quick to dub them “Brangelina. ” At the time, she was a divorced mother of an adopted son, Maddox, having ended her marriage to the actor Billy Bob Thornton in 2003. Mr. Pitt was still married to the “Friends” star Jennifer Aniston. Ms. Aniston filed for divorce from the actor in March 2005. That summer a spread appeared in the   glossy magazine W. Shot by Steven Klein and headlined “Domestic Bliss: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt at Home,” it comprised 60 pages of photographs of Mr. Pitt, Ms. Jolie and five boys (all of them models) who somewhat resembled Mr. Pitt, in a chic, early 1960s setting. Their most recent project as a couple, the 2015 film “By the Sea,” directed by Ms. Jolie Pitt, told a different story. “Meta with a vengeance, ‘By the Sea' stars Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt as itinerant married artists who are suffering, beautifully, through a rough patch,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. Asked about the process of directing her husband, Ms. Jolie Pitt told Vanity Fair, “A few friends asked if we were crazy. ” The moody film was a   flop, grossing $3. 3 million. During the course of their relationship, the Jolie Pitt clan expanded. In addition to Maddox, 15, whom she adopted in Cambodia in 2002, the couple are parents to Zahara, 11, from Ethiopia Shiloh, to whom she gave birth in Namibia in 2006 Pax, 12, adopted in Vietnam and the twins Vivienne and Knox, 8, to whom Ms. Jolie Pitt gave birth in 2008. Ms. Jolie Pitt and Mr. Pitt have separately discussed struggling with   behavior in their younger years. Both seemed to have overcome the dark periods, with a slew of high grossing, critically acclaimed films to their names and a   commitment to philanthropy. She began working for the United Nations in 2000 as a   ambassador, and became the special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2012. She has gone on dozens of missions to countries around the world, including Iraq, Jordan and Myanmar. Last year she addressed the United Nations Security Council, arguing that the United Nations was failing the people of Syria. Earlier this month, Ms. Jolie Pitt spent three days at the Azraq camp in Jordan, which is home to more than 37, 000 Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations. During her years with Mr. Pitt, she had box office hits with the action movie “Wanted” and the Disney fantasy “Maleficent” while also making a name for herself as a director of serious fare like “In the Land of Blood and Honey,” a love story set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War, and “Unbroken. ” He has won an Oscar for producing the critically acclaimed “12 Years a Slave” and has been nominated for several other Oscars, including for best actor for “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and for “Moneyball. ” He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Golden Globe for his role in “Babel. ” In 2013, Ms. Jolie Pitt wrote a candid and widely praised   page essay for The New York Times  about choosing to have a preventive double mastectomy. She followed it up in 2015 with an essay on her next preventive surgery, during which her ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed. While he wears his political commitments more lightly than Ms. Jolie Pitt, Mr. Pitt is a founder of Not on Our Watch, a nongovernmental organization devoted to preventing genocide, and the founder of Make It Right, which builds homes and other structures for people in need. Over the course of their time together, the couple demonstrated an unusual ability to negotiate with the media. After Shiloh was born in 2006, the couple sold photos of the mother and newborn to People magazine for an estimated $4. 1 million, all of which they donated to charity. That same year they negotiated with People on another deal, giving the magazine exclusive photos of Ms. Jolie and Maddox for an estimated $750, 000 and the promise to cover Ms. Jolie Pitt's charity work. Later, they received an estimated $14 million from People and Hello! magazines  —   for shots of their twins  —   and again donated the funds to charity. On Tuesday, with the announcement of the split, the hashtag #Brangelina quickly became the top trending item on Twitter, with fans reacting to the news with a range of emotions, including laments over the death of love complaints that the news was superseding President Obama's speech at the United Nations and theories that the news was a welcome distraction from the presidential campaign. Ms. Jolie Pitt was silent on the matter, but Mr. Pitt gave a statement to People magazine: “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the   of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time. ”",

         "Student Petitions for School's Name Change: Slave Owner James Madison's Name Means Black Students ‘Unsafe' - Breitbart",
         "Dr. Susan Berry",
         "A student at James Madison Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin is seeking to change the name of the school, citing that President James Madison was a slave owner, a fact she says makes the school “unsafe” for black students. [Mya Berry, a senior, says the fact that President James Madison inherited slaves, along with his Montpelier plantation, from his father means her school  —   which, like the city of Madison, Wisconsin, is named after the fourth U. S. president  —   is hostile to black students, reports the Capital Times.  In a change. org petition, which currently has nearly 1, 500 supporters, Berry states: The significance of this name in association with my school has a negative effect on memorials black students. The lack of representation I feel in this school makes me feel more than unsafe. I do not feel supported by the majority of staff at memorial, especially considering the fact that I've gotten called n word multiple times, along with having an individual threaten me by telling me they would lynch me. Berry continues in her petition that when race is discussed at school, she is “told my perspective is just an opinion, and not anything valid to take into consideration. ” “With all the injustice I and others face in James Madison Memorial High School, do you truly think it's appropriate to glorify a man that enslaved my ancestors?” she writes, adding that another reason to remove Madison's name from the school is the “education disparity” between white and black students. Berry also told the Capital Times she has never reported incidents in which she was allegedly threatened because she did not feel comfortable doing so. She also said the incidents did not happen over the course of the current school year. “At the time, I didn't feel safe. I didn't know who to reach out to. Now that I'm a senior and I've become more comfortable speaking out, I've told more people about it,” she said. “I feel like faculty overhear injustice and they know it's wrong. Some of them don't speak up, and that adds to the unsafe environment. ” James Madison High principal Jay Affeldt said he was unaware of Berry's issues. “I have met and will continue to meet with Ms. Berry and other student leaders to discuss how we can best move forward to have this dialog as a larger school community in a safe and healthy way,” he told the Capital Times. “Also, I do not believe the specific incidents mentioned in the petition were ever reported to school staff, and I am trying to learn more about these incidents from Ms. Berry. ” “It's important to me that every student feels safe, and we take all reports of hurtful behavior very seriously,” he said.",

         "Kristina Wong",
         "United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday that the national threat level remains at “Severe,” meaning a terrorist attack is “highly likely. ”[“JTAC  —   that's the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre  —   have confirmed that the national threat level remains at Severe that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely,” she said after a meeting of top national security officials.  She said police have put additional security measures in place to protect the public and provide reassurance, including additional security measures at a number of bridges in London. May said all three attackers in Saturday's attack have been identified, and that when “progress in the investigation permits,” their names will be released. She said 11 individuals are being held in police custody, following the search of two premises. Scotland Yard have subsequently identified two of the killers. “The police are working hard to establish the identity of all of those who were tragically killed or injured in the event on Saturday night, but it is now clear that, sadly, victims came from a number of nationalities. This was an attack on London and the United Kingdom, but it was also an attack on the free world,” the Prime Minister said. There were seven people killed and at least 48 injured, including 21 critically, after the three attackers drove into pedestrians on the London Bridge, then got out and began stabbing people at pubs and restaurants at the Borough Market. The three attackers were shot and killed by police. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley urged anyone with information or footage of the incident to contact police. He said the public can expect to see additional police  —   both armed and unarmed  —   across London. “Our secrity and policing plans for events are being reviewed. The public will also see an increased physical measures in order to keep public safe on London's bridges,” he said. Rowley said the investigation was progressing “at pace, and significant progress has been made. “Finally, I ask the public to remain calm but vigilant  —   and if you see anything suspicious, no matter how insignificant you might think it is, please contact the   hotline on 0800 789 321.

         "Doctors Restore Ken Burns' Full-Color Vision After Removing Massive Tumor From Filmmaker's Visual Cortex Close Vol 52 Issue 43 · News · Celebrities · Entertainment · Healthcare \nCLEVELAND—Speaking to reporters following the successful eight-hour procedure Tuesday, neurosurgeons at the Cleveland Clinic confirmed they had removed a golf ball-sized tumor from the visual cortex of filmmaker Ken Burns, restoring the documentarian's ability to see in full color. “We're happy to report that the surgery went smoothly, and beginning today, Mr. Burns will no longer be limited to perceiving the world in shades of black, white, and sepia, and will instead be able to experience the entire spectrum of hues that most of us take for granted,” said Dr. Amrita Singh, noting that the 63-year-old director and producer of The Civil War , Prohibition , and Jazz had awakened from anesthesia and was reported to be marveling at the vividness of his surroundings, human faces, and photographs. “It appears that the removal of this tumor also reduced intense pressure that had built up inside Mr. Burns' visual processing center; as a result, his eyesight has sharpened considerably, and he'll notice that he won't need to lean in close anymore to make out the details of images. It's going to seem like a whole new world to him.” Dr. Singh added that an additional inner-ear surgery would be required to correct the balance issue that causes Burns to slowly drift from left to right.
